Scott,

Richard Tomaski wants one more physical book set up under the Enovate name 
while retaining the other books already set up.  This counterparty name 
Enovate is replacing the Midwest Energy Hub.  But wants to be able to 
differentiate deals done as solely Enovate with deals done as Enron Midwest.  
Call me if you have any further questions, or if this presents a problem.  
Thanks.

OK, so the classes start this week.  The first one will be on what to look 
for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.  Will Kelly and I will 
present the class.  We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the 
most beneficial part will be individual questions.  So bring them if you have 
them.  We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.  Our breakout 
is as follows:

 Group1   Group2
 Carole    Jennifer
 Jason    Anne
 Chris   

Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @ 
11:30am.  We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.  Thanks.

********************************************************

Dear UT Alumni and Friends,

There are two funding issues before the Texas Legislature that are of
critical importance to The University of Texas
at Austin and all of higher education.  These issues are:

Increasing university tuition rates by $2 a semester credit hour each year
through the 2005-2006 academic year; and
Retaining 100% of indirect cost funding earned on research awards and
contracts.

WE NEED YOU TO CONTACT LEGISLATORS TO VOICE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE
MEASURES.  Unless these two issues are passed
by the Legislature, UT Austin risks being less competitive with its peer
institutions for faculty and research dollars,
and will lose the momentum that resulted from the investment made in higher
education for the last two legislative sessions.

INCREASING TUITION: Senate Bill 1466 by Senator Teel Bivins and House Bill
2531 by Representative Rob Junell would authorize
a $2 a semester credit hour increase in tuition rates each year through the
2005-2006 academic year.  The House bill also
increases tuition by $1 a semester credit hour for each of the following
five years.  We do not know which bill will
move first.  However, one of these bills should be before the full Senate
or House soon.  Please call your State Senator
and Representative and other members you know and say, "I support SB 1466
and HB 2531, the bills to increase tuition
rates at universities, and urge you to vote for this legislation when it
reaches the Senate/House floor." (Phone numbers available
at http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/senmem.htm and
http://www.house.state.tx.us/house/member.htm)
(or copy this address into the location/address field of your
browser)  Reasons to support the bill include:

Texas ranks 32nd among the states in total tuition and fees paid to
comprehensive colleges and universities.

Tuition is a necessary part of the financing for university operations
since general revenue provides only a portion of state
appropriated funds.  The first year revenue gain from the tuition increase
for all universities would be about $22 million.
Of that amount, over $6 million would flow to UT System universities.

Fifteen percent of the tuition increase is devoted automatically to student
financial aid.

RETENTION OF 100% OF INDIRECT COST FUNDING: Senate Bill 1, the State budget
bill, uses 50% of the indirect cost funds earned
by a university on research awards and contracts to offset university
appropriations.  The Conference Committee on SB 1 may consider
allowing universities to retain up to 100% of these funds.  Please call
members of the Conference Committee on SB 1 and say,
"I support allowing universities to retain 100% of indirect cost funds
earned on research grants and contracts, and urge you to
make that change in the Appropriations Bill, SB 1."  The 10 Senators and
Representatives on the Conference Committee are:
Senators Rodney Ellis (512-463-0113), Robert Duncan (512-463-0128), Chris
Harris (512-463-0110), Steve Ogden (512-463-0105) and Judith
Zaffirini (512-463-0121), and Representatives Rob Junell (512-463-0472),
Garnet Coleman (512-463-0524), Pete Gallego (512-463-0566),
Talmadge Heflin (512-463-0568), and Buddy West (512-463-0546).
Reasons to support this change are:

All of the ten most populous states allow their institutions to retain 100%
of their indirect costs, except for Florida, whose
institutions retain 98%, and Texas, whose universities get only 50%.

UT Austin would gain an estimated $16.3 million per year in additional
revenue with this change.  This revenue could be
used to expand UT's research capabilities by supporting faculty, providing
seed money for new projects and purchasing
research-related equipment.

Three recent reports recommend that Texas universities be allowed to retain
100% of indirect cost funding.  These
include reports from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, a
special commission appointed by then-Lieutenant
Governor Rick Perry, and Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts Carole Rylander.

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO SUPPORT YOUR UNIVERSITY BY CONTACTING LEGISLATORS
ON THESE TWO IMPORTANT ISSUES.

The hotel does not confirm bed type until arrival, the last line in the
hotel field indicates where I requested two doubles for you.

Hi 
If you've aleady received this, my  apologies. On the other hand, if not, 

please read and forward around the world. 

Nike now lets you personalize your shoes by submitting a word or  phrase 
which they will stitch onto your shoes, under the  swoosh. So Jonah 
Peretti 
filled  out the form and sent them $50 to stitch "sweatshop" onto his 
shoes. 

Here's the responses he got... fun and games with Nike...

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the  following 
reasons: 

1) Your Personal iD contains another party's trademark  
2) Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we  do not 
have 
the legal right to  use 
3) Your Personal iD was left blank. Did you not want  any 
personalization? 
4) Your  Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang, and 
besides, 
your mother would slap us.  
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at  www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD

Greetings, 

My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate  any of 
the 
criteria outlined in  your message. The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes was the word  "sweatshop." 
Sweatshop is not: 
1) another's party's trademark, 
2) the name of an  athlete, 
3) blank, or 
4)  profanity. 

I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor  of the 
children that made my shoes. Could you please  ship them to me 
immediately. 

Thanks and Happy New Year, Jonah Peretti

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have  chosen 
contains, as 
stated in  the previous e-mail correspondence, "inappropriate slang". 
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at nike.com  

Thank you, NIKE iD 

From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <peretti@media.mit.edu>  
To: "Personalize, NIKE iD"  <nikeid_personalize@nike.com> 
Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom  ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes.  Although I commend you for your prompt customer service, 
I 
disagree with the claim that my personal iD  was 
inappropriate slang. After consulting Webster's  Dictionary, I discovered 

that "sweatshop" is in fact part of standard English, and not  slang. 

The word means: "a shop or factory in which workers are employed  for 
long 
hours at low wages and  under unhealthy conditions" and its origin dates 
from  1892. So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your 
first 
email. 

Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is "about  freedom to 
choose and freedom to express who you are." I  share Nike's love of 
freedom 
and  personal expression. The site also says that "If you want it 
done right...build it yourself." I was thrilled to be able to build  my 
own 
shoes, and my personal iD  was offered as a small token of appreciation 
for  
the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision. I  hope that 
you 
will value my  freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to 
reject 
my order. 

Thank you, Jonah Peretti 

From: "Personalize, NIKE iD"  <nikeid_personalize@nike.com> 
To: "'Jonah H.  Peretti'" <peretti@media.mit.edu> 
Subject: RE:  Your NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the  NIKE iD 
web 
site that "Nike  reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to 24 
hours 
after it has been submitted". In addition,  it further explains: "While 
we 
honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor every one. 
Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of  certain 
professional sports teams, athletes or  celebrities that Nike does not 
have 
the right to use. Others may contain material that we consider  
inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our  products. 
Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to  decline personal iDs that may 

otherwise seem unobjectionable. In any event, we will let you  know if we 

decline your personal iD, and we will offer you the chance to  submit 
another." With these rules in mind, we cannot  accept your order as 
submitted. If you wish to reorder  your NIKE iD product with a new 
personalization please  visit us again at www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD 

From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <peretti@media.mit.edu>  
To: "Personalize, NIKE iD"  <nikeid_personalize@nike.com> 
Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request.  I have 
decided to order the shoes with a different iD,  but I would like to make 
one 
small request. Could you please send me a color snapshot of the  
ten-year-old Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes? 

Thanks, 
Jonah Peretti 

As one forwarder writes: 

... this will now go round the world much farther and faster  than any of 
the 
adverts they  paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all 

their sweatshop workers in the world to do... 

I normally avoid making a plea to pass on these things,  
but this time I say: 

JUST DO IT

Hi Jeff,

Could you please do me a favor, and make sure that all Canadian deals
that are in Houston books are flipped to the P& book.  I don't have a current 
list of
all the desk leads, so I thought that I'd ask you to forward this message
on to them for me.  I know that the EOL group is still working on a solution
to our problem, but there are still deals that are in Houston books
that need to be flipped.

Please let me know if there is anything I can help with.  Thanks for your
help on this.

> Least compatible with Sales.
>
> 2) SALES
> Laziest of all signs, often referred to as "marketing without a degree."
> You are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and

> Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying but who the hell can

> 4) ENGINEERING

Subject: Gas Daily "four leg" Booking

Hi Dutch,

I was hoping you could spread the word to the book admins regarding a data 
entry methodology requirement for Gas Daily 4 legged deals. The Confirms 
group is working with Ricky Dang to expand the logic and capabilities of 
their systems to accomodate automated confirms on deals done in the new 
format, but in order for this to work, it is critical that all Gas Daily 4 
legged deals entered manually into TAGG be booked in the same leg order as 
those which bridge automatically. Although the legs can technically be 
entered in any order as far as Risk is concerned, such deviations will cause 
failures from the confirm end. If the Gas Daily book admins can follow the 
same entry order used in deal # Q25289.1, .2, .3, .4 , the Confirms Group 
should be able to work with it from there. Just let me know if this will 
create any problems from your end. Thanks!

Torrey

Lunch still good for you guys?  Anytime is good for me, but noon or after
would be better, if this meeting runs late.  What time is good for you
guys?  Also, suggestions for where would be good.  It probably needs to be
central downtown since Giron is on the south side.  Let me know.

guys think about September 30th?  Let me know who all can make it or suggest 
other dates that are more agreeable to your schedule!

Thanks,

We have a 7:30 shotgun start tomorrow morning.  We will have to pay and get 
out to our hole, so give yourself some time if you want to hit a few before 
we tee off.  We still need one more person.  Everyone else already had 
plans.  If you know of anyone who would like to play, invite them and let me 
know his name.  Unfortunaltey Jeff, you are the only guy who is any good.

West on Hwy 290
Pass the Beltway - Remember I said it's BFE
Exit Spring Cypress/Cypress Rosehill (About 12 miles past the Beltway)
Go thru 2 stop signs (First one is Spring Cypress-Second one is Cypress 
Rosehill)
After 2nd stop sign, make first right (there is not a stop sign at the 
intersection) - I believe the street is Cypress Chase
The road will dead end into a T
Make a left and the course is on the right - You can't miss it

I'll have my cell phone on if you get lost - 832-563-6328.  Call me if you 
have any questions.  Thanks.

Subject: Gas Daily Curves

When Gas Daily curves are created in ERMS, the rate server group has told me 
that the GDP designated curves should be those that are 
actually  published, that they can get an outside feed to pull in the rates.  
Internally created curves used for gas daily purposes should be 
designated as a GDC curve.  If curves created in the future could follow this 
naming convention it would make the curve names more meaningful.

Normal GDP curves need to be set up by the global rate server group, dummy 
internal curves can be set up in global by us.

Any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks

NEW EMAIL: 
Mike,

The reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is 
that the postid in question did not have a net position.  The procedure 
Rahmann showed you is where we check GERMS positions to the position reports 
we run using Excel queries.  If a postid has a net position and is not 
officialized, it will be caught using this procedure.  It will not, however, 
if the postid does not have a position.  I understand the importance of 
officializing postid's, as does the entire West desk.  Thanks.

Jeff,

FYI - Darron Giron didn't officialize the West-NW-GDL book on Friday.  Please 
re-emphasize the importance of not forgetting.  Also, Rahmann showed me a 
control he has to catch books not officialized each night which looked like 
an effective tool.  I wonder why he didn't see this book on Friday.

We have been tracking books that are not officialized on a daily basis.  This 
list goes to Sally Beck and is reviewed at the end of each week by Rick Buy.  
Rick has been vocal about taking corrective action if people forget to 
officialize.   It is imperative that we take extra care to ensure that all 
books are marked official each night before going home.  A control process 
should be implemented immediately to absolutely avoid being on the list.  

Please contact me if you have any questions (x-35242).

Thanks,

I need two Sitara books set up in a new region.  The region can be called 
Enovate with the books IM Enovate and FT Enovate.  They are part of the other 
Chicago books:  Midwest, Midwest Program 1, and Midwest Program 2.  I have 
attached the book request I sent Susan Trevino.  Let me know if there is

What is Love

A group of professional people posed this question to
a group of 4 to 8 year-olds, "What does love mean?"

The answers they got were broader and deeper than
anyone could have imagined. See what you think.

"When you tell someone something bad about yourself
and you're scared they won't love you anymore. But
then you get surprised because not only do they still
love you, they love you even more." Matthew - age 7

"Love is that first feeling you feel before all the
bad stuff gets in the way." - Charlie age 5

"God could have said magic words to make the nails
fall off the cross,but He didn't. That's love."? Max -
age 5

"When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend
over and paint her toenails anymore. So my grandfather
does it for her all the time, even when his hands got
arthritis too. That's love." - Rebecca - age 8

"When someone loves you, the way they say your name is
different. You know that your name is safe in their
mouth." - Billy - age 4

"Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on
shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other."
- Karl - age 5

"Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most
of your French fries without making them give you any
of theirs." - Chrissy - age 6

"Love is when someone hurts you. And you get so mad
but you don't yell at them because you know it would
hurt their feelings." - Samantha - age 6

"Love is what makes you smile when you're tired." -
Terri - age 4

"Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and
she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure
the taste is OK." - Danny - age 7

"Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get
tired of kissing, you still want to be together and
you talk more. My mommy and Daddy are like that. They
look gross when they kiss." - Emily - age 8

"Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if
you stop opening presents and listen." - Bobby - age 5

"If you want to learn to love better, you should start
with a friend who you hate." - Nikka - age 6

"Love is hugging. Love is kissing. Love is saying no"
- Patty - age 8

"There are two kinds of love. Our love. God's love.
But God makes both kinds of them." - Jenny - age 4

"Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then
he wears it everyday." - Noelle - age 7

"Love is like a little old woman and a little old man
who are still friends even after they know each other
so well." - Tommy - age 6

"During my piano recital, I was on a stage and scared.
I looked at all the people watching me and saw my
daddy waving and smiling. He was the only one doing
that. I wasn't scared anymore." Cindy - age 8

"My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see
anyone else kissing me to sleep at night." - Clare -
Age 5

"Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of
chicken." Elaine -age 5

"Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and
still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford." -
Chris - age 8

"Love is when your puppy licks your face even after
you left him alone all day." - Mary Ann - age 4

"I know my older sister loves me because she gives me
all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new
ones." - Lauren - age - 4

"I let my big sister pick on me because my Mom says
she only picks on me because she loves me. So I pick
on my baby sister because I love her." Bethany - age 4

"Love cards like Valentine's cards say stuff on them
that we'd like to say ourselves, but we wouldn't be
caught dead saying." - Mike - age 8

"When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down
and little stars come out of you." - Karen - age 7

"Love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and she
doesn't think it's gross." - Mark - age 6

"You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean
it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot.
People forget." - Jessica - age 8

Sally -

These are the steps that we have taken to insure that the positions the V@R 
engine picks up are correct:

1. Each book adm. now checks his/her own positions that are going into V@R,  
rather than just one check at  a consolidated level.
2. All regional controllers will receive a sheet at the end of the night, 
verifying that all books are officialized.

Subject: Canadian deals in US books.

Just a quick request for you to go into all your books to make sure that 
there are no ECC deals booked there.  If there are any that are with 
counterparties other than RISKMANTRA, they need to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  Invoicing for November should 
start today, and both ECC and ENA are held back from invoicing until these 
deals are fixed, as the deals will be invoiced by the wrong Enron 
counterparty if they aren't.  If you could please let me know when the deals 
have been fixed, I can let the accounting department in Houston know when 
they can start invoicing as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this matter.

Thank you
Stacey

Hi All -

The following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) project status:

TRV system training for Region Leads began last week.  Currently, Kam, 
Phillip, Darron and Winfree have received training and Errol is scheduled for 
tomorrow (5/15).

One request that came out of training was to provide a "left column freeze" 
in order to scroll across and still maintain what row is being reviewed.  Hal 
will follow up on this request.  Please forward me any additional requests 
that may be required or suggestions you may have. 

Please publish your region's report daily.  This will ensure report history 
is being established and provide realistic information to review during UAT.  
Also, we ask that each one of you review the system as much as possible 
during the UAT review period this week to ensure the system is working 
properly and is meeting your expectations. 

Thank you for your help and support!

Gary,

I need some Tagg books set up for the Chicago office.  I submitted a request 
this morning to create a new counterparty:  Enovate, LLC which will be an 
Enron entity.  Under Enovate LLC I need two books:  FT-ENOVATE and 
INTRA-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  I also need a book which will fall under the 
current Enron MW, LLC counterparty:  FT-INT-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  And as 
usual I need these as soon as possible.  I will be out of the office on 
Friday but will return on Monday.  I really need to get deals moved to these 
books by the end of next week.  Please let me know if there is anything I 
need to do to help.  Thanks as always.

Subject: TDS Physical Positions

In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is 
required between the Org region code used in Portcalc
for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that 
region.

An example would be similar to:

Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code
CENTRAGULF                                  
FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be 
a valid grouping


 TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical 
region codes that are related to it.

Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and 
what Tagg Book it would relate to.
If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers.

Any questions or concerns, please call me.

Thanks
Russ

After looking over the deal, I need to ask Steve Jackson a couple of 
questions.  So I probably will not be able to walk you through the deal today 
because I have some questions myself on a couple of the legs.  I was hoping

Darron,

This is the deal I phoned you about yesterday which Eric Moon put together  
-  should it be booked as Transportation deal instead of a Forward ?

No I don't.  This deal is a Physical Forward.  Usually when it pertains to a 
transportation the trader usually creates a Transportation Capacity ticket in 
Sitara.  When it hits our portfolio we would then set it up in Global 
Contracts.  

Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sylvia,

I'm looking into this deal and after researching it  it seems like there 
should be a separate Transportation Contract for this deal, and should not be 
confirmed by us on the Confirmation desk. Do you know anything about this 
deal or Contract ?

Eric Moon in Gas Structuring is the dealmaker and he asked me to talk to 
Darron Giron who is a book admin.
This deal relates to Tagg # EC3952  -  apparently they pulled loads of 
different transportation deals from our books and sold it on to Calpine. It 
seems to me there must be a Contract out there for this 8 year deal.

Hey folks. Just a note, Calpine Energy Services, LP deal #559974 was 
originally attached to a GTC due to the fact that the contracts group had not 
yet received the master contract. The contract was received & entered into 
Global this week & as a result we moved the above referenced deal to the 
master (Global #96056886). Transaction term information: 5/1/01 - 10/31/08.

Please reconfirm as necessary.

Thanks all!

Darron,

For audit purposes, can you give us a brief description of where the value 
for annuities in TAGG as V42434.9 and V42434.A.  We'll add some comments to 
TAGG to cover ourselves or send out Termination Agreements if necessary.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter


NEW EMAIL: 
How goes it?  I wanted to check in with you and make sure we are still on for 
March.  I also need to let you know we will have an extra person besides the 
four of us.  He is the kid of some people who are driving up and is flying 
with us.  I hope this is OK.  He can acutally babysit so maybe we can go out 
one night.  Let me know.  Also,  I just hired a KU kid just out of undergrad 
school.  He's pretty bummed out about Baylor.  Talk to you soon.

My wife told me that UT pulled the offer from Robinson.  Do you know about 
this?  I couldn't find it on the boards.

Hey Darron, just been working on year-end stuff here.  Too many late
nights.  I have been keeping up with recruiting.  The guy from Jersey
Village is Abe Robinson, a  O-lineman, TE prospect.  He will probably play
offenseive tackle (6'5" -260 - 4.9) and is a top 10-15 prospect in the
state.  Texas will have a top 5 recruiting class but the problem is that OU
will possible have the top 1 or 2 class and have signed the top defensive
player in Texas, Tommie Harris.   A&M is the odd man out in the mix because
of the emergence of OU and LSU.   A&M is going back to pre-Sherrill days.
I would think they will be looking for a new coach next year.

Let's try to get together soon.  Maybe have lunch or something.

Talk to you soon

Subject: Audit Request procedure


Jeff, 
Thanks for the lead with Avril Forster, it looks like that will help us in 
the near future.  Until we can get EnTelligence built to our specifications, 
we'll need to continue to go to the different desks to provide Mark-to-Market 
valuations for a Counterparty's portfolio.

Desk heads,

Can you provide to Ellen and myself the names of the person on your desk who 
we should go to with these requests.  Also, please let these persons know 
that we will be coming to them often with these requests (we recieve several 
per week).

Here's the background of these requests.  Because of various accounting 
rules, Parties dealing in Derivatives must show third party valuations to 
their Auditors.  Our group (Confirmations) is responsible for providing MTM 
values and open position reports for these parties.  We do not have access to 
any system that values these deals, but are looking to get the on-line 
"EnTelligence" built so that it carries back-dated curves that will allow us 
to complete these requests without taking up a Risk person's time and without 
having to black out information (Delta/Vol) that is included in a mini-book.

Thanks for the help.  We'll try to get these off of your plates as soon as 
possible.

Joe

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Effective immediately,  if anyone changes any deal for any reason,  they need 
to provide a minibook with a before and after of exactly what they did.  This 
used to be a common courtesy,  but it looks like we need a stated policy in 
place.  You guys will therefore have to get minibook access to calc all books 
on a mini-book level from Jeremy.  Please let me know the timing Jeremy gives 
for getting the appropriate people mini-book access as soon as possible.  It 
is critical that we get this done right away.  I know that this is not a 
one-sided issue.  No group is better or more important than any other group.  
It is therefore important that we do a better job of communicating across 
groups.

Subject: Deals in the MGMT-WEST book

Hi Jeff,

I'm hoping you're the person who takes care of this book.  If not, could
you please forward this message to the appropriate person.  There are
a few deals in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be moved to the
FT-US/CAND-ERMS BOOK.  These are all EnronOnline deals so they
were put into this book automatically.

Q24809.1
Q47957.1
Q50596.1

Could you please tell everyone down there that books deals into Houston
books, to make sure that there aren't any ECC deals with counterparties
in these books.  Nymex closes today, and I'm going to have to start invoicing
on Monday, so I need to have all deals with ECC in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS
book by the end of today.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter.

Thanks for your help
Stacey

I was going to last night, but it didn't sound like you wanted to talk.  We 
had a great time.  Only wish we could have stayed longer.  It was cold but 
the game was fun.  It was good to see the kids getting along as well as they 
did.  We will try and make it a regular trip.  We also spoke about maybe 
getting together in Dallas sometime next year.  I need to go, but will talk 
to you later.

Don't worry about it.  If you can't go, you can't go.  You are not going to

Darron,

Thank you for the directions and the tickets.  Unfortunately, I have not been 
feeling well and I may not end up going.  However, I should know more by 
tommarrow.  If someone else can use the tickets then by all mean let them use 
them.  If no one uses the tickets, then I will cover the cost of the tickets 
since you were saving them for me.  I still really want to go and maybe after 
another nights rest I might feel better, so I will give you a call in the 
morning.

Thanks again.

Adios,

JDLIII



NEW EMAIL: 
How are you feeling?  I'm very tired and stiff.  I've been thinking, and I 
know you feel like I make all of the decisions around our house when it comes 
to $.  So I want us to do what you want on the pool and a car when it comes 
to financing.  I will completely agree with whatever you think we should do.  
And I'm not doing this for any other reason except that I want you to know 
that I value your judgement and ideas.  Have a great day.  As always, I love 
you very much.

Kristi said you called on Saturday.  I was golfing.  What did you think about

Hey Darron,

What's going on??  Just wanted to say thanks for inviting me to go out on
the boat last weekend.  Hope I was not rude when we were leaving, but I
really started to feel like crap.  When we got back to Scott's I almost
puked a couple times and was stuck on the crapper for some time.  I ended up
not going to work on Monday and half of Tuesday because of the hebee jebees.
Anyway, if you ever need anyone to help you with the boat when you go out
(uh, yeah), give me a call and I would be glad to 'help' out.

Mike

I appologize for the delay.  I was on vacation when you sent the first

We'll let you know when it is complete.

NEW EMAIL: 
OK, so I really screwed up.  I was getting the tickets out last night so I 
wouldn't forget them this morning and remembered that I am going to the 
airport, not the office.  So I'll call you when I get in later this 
afternoon.  I thought about FedEx, but don't want to take the chance that 
they get lost in the Enron building.  I hope you travel via 290 to Austin 
because I think the easiest solution is for me to leave them at my house and 
you could pick them up on you way out.  I also have a couple of EndZone 
passes with the tickets.  Sorry for the screw-up.  I'll talk to you this 
afternoon.

We are pleased to pass along to you the fact that United HealthCare (UHC) and 
Memorial Herman Health Systems (MHHS) reached agreement on a long-term 
contract.   There will be no disruption in terms of accessing network 
services from the hospital system or those providers who were scheduled to be 
terminated.  Employees currently electing UHC will receive a confirming 
letter shortly from UHC.

As mentioned in our earlier memo, it is our understanding that Cigna has also 
been contacted by MHHS and are now in contract negotiations. 

Open Enrollment packages are in the mail and you should consider the above 
facts when making your decision on your medical election.

I'm out of the office this morning.  I'll get back to you later about the

Greg,
I got confirmation from the Head Coach at JV that AR is not going to UT. He 
scored a 760 on his SAT and apparently overslept a retake exam.  So I don't 
know if they actually pulled the offer, but it sure sounds like it.  Either 
way, the coach told my wife he will not be a Horn.  The coach is really 
dissapointed in AR.

Kim,

How are you?  I got your address from Sean and wanted to make sure it 
worked.  I just sent a note to your dad asking if he was going to be in town 
for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on taking the whole group up for 
the KU-UT game.  I hope you will be in town as well.  Let me know.  Take care.

On second thought, it might be easier to allow the two books to have deals on 
any Central pipe.  We will make sure that the deals are on the correct 
counterparty (North or South)

Darron, do you know which pipes these two new business units will be 
trading?  I need to make sure that all necessary pipes are mapped to these 
business units in order for traders to be able to book deals on them.  Let me 
know if there are specific ones they will be using or if they just need all 
pipes that are currently mapped to the ENA - IM Central business unit also 
mapped to these two new business units.

Subject: Technical Questions

I also do not have many tech questions.  I look for trainability as well.  

My questions:
-What do you know about the commodities market?
-Do you do any online trading, if so what, and why - looking for trading of 
options,  stocks, futs, etc for more difficult follow-up questions like
    why options, not buy/sell the underlying.  How do you determine what to 
trade and when, how long do you hold it.  Also looking for how often they 
play        on the internet and whether they do it at work.  
-What do you know about the industry?  How many units in a contract?  How do 
you hedge physical gas?  Financial positions?  
-What is V@R?  Not looking for a technical answer, just if they are familiar 
with the concept?  What other trading controls do they expect to be in place?
-How well do you handle ridicule?  (Always looking for a certain central 
trader's new lackey)
-How well versed are you in Excel?  What have you done where you are using 
excel to improve your work product?  How did you learn it?  Have you shared 
it with anyone else?  What other improvements have you made?  Would you give 
me a name of a person I could verify the impact this has had in your current 
organization?  (I don't ever call, I just am looking to see if there answer 
is the truth and what kind of ego they have) 
-Further educational goals?  MBA, CFA,  - looking for goals and motivators.
-Are you easily incited to violence?

Subject: Technical Questions

I do not have very many technical questions but here a the few that I have 
used:

- Do you understand what curveshift is?  If so ... Price today was $10.20 and 
yesterday it was $10.13 ... what was my curveshift?
- What makes up a P&L statement?
- What is MTM accounting?  accrual accounting?
- If they have knowledge of options, what is a delta position?

I guess these are more general analytical questions:

- Give me an example of an problem you've had and how you solved it?
- The "eight ball" question (basic problem solving)
- The "light switch" question (advanced problem solving)

When I interview I am looking for trainability, better than average problem 
solving skills and a desire to work in this environment.  If the candidate 
has these skills then I believe we can teach them what they need to know.  I 
also think it is candidates with these basic attributes that are a better fit 
for us.  They know they don't know everything (about Risk) and work hard to 
get up to speed.

Gary and I are going to have a "get together" before the Holiday Party on 
Saturday, December 9th.  Please let me know if you want to stop by our place 
before we head out to Enron Field.  We live really only a few miles away from 
downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in 
the "burbs"!   (No names mentioned).  

Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and I will give you directions 
to our place.  Hope all of you can make it!

as SIQ (see below) which is priced at NGPL.ILL-CITYGATE.NGI.M.I - .02 USD, 
not tier priced as shown below in Sitara.  Unless there's some reason I'm not

 Do you put together a spreadsheet calculating the price for gas purchases

For 08/00 production, there is a $.56 difference from what is in Sitara and

Hi guys,

Here is a list of the deals that I've come across in the different books that 
still need to be flipped to the P& book by the end of today.

FT-CENT     

QU4059.1

FT-NORTHWEST



FT-ONTARIO

Subject: FW: Golf joke




A husband and wife want to take golf lessons from a pro at a local country
club. The man and woman meet the pro and head onto the driving range. The
man goes up to hit first. He swings and hits the ball 100 yards. The golf
pro says not bad. Golfpro: "Now hold the club as firm as you hold your
wife's breasts". The man follows instructions and hits the ball 300 yards.
The golf pro says "Excellent!" Now the woman takes her turn. Her ball goes
30 yards. Golfpro: "Not bad, try holding the club like you hold your
husbands penis." She swings and the ball goes 10 yards. Golfpro: "Not bad,
but now try taking the club out of your mouth and hit the ball."

It was nice to hear from both of you on Easter Sunday. ?I spent most of the  
afternoon working in the back yard hauling dirt and transplanting stuff. ?I  
went to a wedding earlier in the day near the Med Center. 

Before things get too hectic I wanted to let you know that I will be in  
Washington DC from Sunday, April 29-Friday, May 4. ?Larry has all the  
details...flight, hotel, etc. ?So, Krtisti, I cannot keep the kids on May 1. 

Hope you have a good week. ?MOM

Just when you thought you knew everything (no, it's not an anti cola add  
;-)...  

1.In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck  
to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
2.You can put a  T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two 
days. 
3.To clean a  toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl....... Let 
the "real thing"  sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains  from vitreous china. 
5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the  bumper with a 
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in  Coca-Cola. 
6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of  Coca-Cola 
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 
7.To loosen a  rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the 
rusted bolt for several  minutes. 
8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking  pan;rap the 
ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is  finished, 
remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a  sumptuous 
brown gravy. 
9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke  into a load of greasy 
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.  The Coca-Cola will 
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze  fromyour 
windshield.  

FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It  
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 
2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the  concentrate) the commercial truck must use 
the Hazardous material place cards  reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
3.The distributors of coke have  been using it to clean the engines of their 
trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!  No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
drinks do to your teeth on a daily  basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of 
coke in 24-48 hours.

Thanks,

NEW EMAIL: 
I think it will be a very close game.  Except for the fart against Colorado,  
you just don't bet against the Aggies at Kyle Field.  OU is obviously a very 
good team.  But I think more importantly, they are just playing great 
football.  They make plays when they need them, and I know it sounds like 
sour grapes, but frankly, they are also getting lucky.  When the QB heaves a 
pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a TD week after week, 
the football Gods are smiling on you big time.  But regardless, you've got to 
admire Stoops and the job he has done.  They have proven for three 
consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best 
defenses in the country.  

And as far as the Horns are concerned, I still think they are just an above 
average team.  They have beaten no one of any (and I mean any) significance.  
They were completely outclassed against the one (albeit right now, the best 
team in the country) good team they have played.  And lost to a bad Stanford 
team.  But the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may 
result in a T+1 win.  But right now, I think the Aggies have a better team.  
But if they start thinking about aTM, they will lose to both Tech and KU.  
They are not good enough to play poorly and win against decent competition.

DG

Don't think  I'm crazy, but I think the Aggies will beat OU (man I would
hate that, we would never hear the end of it).  Crazy things happen in
College Station,  I wish I were out of the country on that day.   Right
now, the Aggies look like they could beat us.  We better get our shit
together.  What are your thoughts?  Again, I hope I'm wrong but the Aggies
worry me.

Mark,

I think I need some help reconciling what Steve Richman has and we have 
booked for the HUB deals.  He sent me a spreadsheet with deals but I cannot 
even come close to tying them out to what we have booked in Tagg.  Richard 
suggested I contact you since Steve is out.  Attached is a list of deals we 
currently have booked in Tagg for the HUB deals.  They need to be verified 
before I can calc them for value and positions.  I will be out tomorrow, 
returning on Monday.  Thanks for your help.  Please call me with any 
questions.

Subject: Excel file to help you out

Here is a spreadsheet I worked up to help you determine what files need to be 
cleaned up.  It is pretty simple and straightforward.  You can enter a 
directory, file extention (if you want all file types, just enter a "*"), a 
minimum file size, and a modified before date.  The spreadsheet will perform 
a search of the directory and all subdirectories and return the files 
matching the criteria you specified.

The information is returned sorted by directory, but you can then sort by 
size, date, or whatever.

This should help you make a quick pass through your files on the "O" drive to 
determine some of the older/bigger ones you can clean up.

I would encourage you not to just enter "O:\" in the directory because the 
program will take forever, and you will run out of rows in excel to store the 
data.  Since it is in Excel, it will take just a while if you run it on a 
directory with a lot of files, so be a little patient.

I don't want to spend a lot of time supporting this thing, so if you 
distribute further, just don't tell them where you got it from (unless you 
want to designate a given person on your desk to perform the work).  

Let me know if you have questions or problems.

Greg

Tim,

The document attached directly below this verbage is what I included to our 
risk folks as we discovered
that the way we were booking NSS was not correct.  Below this attachment is 
our risk director's independent
solution to the problem; you will note that it is the same conclusion that we 
(Richard and myself) came up with
(see the e-mail I sent at the very bottom of this e-mail).  

Hopefully this will help.

Subject: Proposed Change to correct the flaws regarding the NSS program

Richard, Lee, and myself met this afternoon and reviewed the memo I prepared 
intending to find and propose a solution
to our existing valuation problem.   We think we have the answer.  We would 
appreciate any comments from our risk experts.

The following change to our existing deal is what we think will solve the 
problem.  All that we are doing is changing the fixed
price on Legs 2 and 3 to 0.  If you refer to the example mentioned in my 
earlier memo, you will note that the p/l attributable to 
this deals should be 52,777; by changing these legs to 0 we accomplish this 
end result.  

     

I look forward to any feedback any of you may have to offer.

Subject: TW transportation index hedges entered into 1/2001

Thanks for your assistance and that of Jeff.   In addition to the 8 trades 
sent yesterday (see below), which Jeff is assisting on the offsetting 
positions, we have another done on March 7, 2001  ticket # QV8401.1, please 
add it to the list.

At year end Ron Baker worked with your group to document the offsetting third 
party positions on the following trades.

NI8156.1
NK4742.1
NT6154.1
NV5358.1


I understand that as a result of that work about 97 third party trades were 
identified to offset these 4 Transwestern trades.  Somehow an effectiveness 
test was done.  We were not involved in any of that work and I hope all 97 
trades (If that is the correct number) are still on ENA's books and are still 
effective.  At this time I don't see how I can measure effectiveness without 
the third party positions in our books.  Can ENA met the effectiveness 
standard and measurement requirements of SFAS 133 or is it the responsibility 
of the business unit that originated the hedge.  At this time we are only 
measuring our own positions.   Roger, indicated in the below memo that Ernie 
was going to do the effectiveness testing.   

We need your advice on if we should continue hedging positions with ENA.  I 
am concerned that ETS does not have the ability to monitor and maintain 
effectiveness when ENA facilitates the transaction because ETS loses control 
of the offseting 3rd party position.   I was under the impression that 
intercompany trades were kept in an affiliate book.  Perhaps we can get 
together next week and work out documentation procedures and the use of the 
affiliate book.  Anyday except Monday. 

Thanks,  Dan

I hope you can help me with this.  I need to find a way to identify 
offsetting 3rd party derivative transactions relating to the internal trades 
done with TW for the following deals:

TW RMTC QL2915.1
TW RMTC QL2918.1

not, do you have any suggestions?

Subject: TW transportation index hedges entered into 1/2001


	

Dan/Bob,
Following my voice mail message (to Dan), I want to circle back on the 
accounting impact of the recent internal transportation derivatives between 
TW and RMTC.

The concern that has arisen is that TW has taken the "out-of-the-money" 
impact of these trades (approx. $27MM) to OCI while RMTC has marked the 
"in-the-money" impact through income.

TW has taken its impact to OCI because it is, on a standalone accounts basis, 
designating these internal trades in cash flow hedge relationships.

However, from an Enron consolidated financial position viewpoint, the 
internal trades cannot be designated as hedges (and, thus, would need to be 
reversed which would have a negative impact on earnings of $27MM).

So, in order not to have this negative impact, 3rd party "offset" 
transactions in ENA must be identified and documented as cash flow hedge 
transactions.

It may be that RMTC has already identified offsetting 3rd party derivative 
transactions relating to the internal trades done with TW. 

However, if not, we think that the best place for responsibility for getting 
these 3rd party trades IDENTIFIED AND PROPERLY DOCUMENTED IN CASH FLOW HEDGE 
RELATIONSHIPS is with the business unit that wanted the internal trade in the 
first place - i.e. TW in this case.

If this has not already been done, can you have someone in your shop work 
with ENA to identify and obtain copies of sufficient 3rd party trades that 
hedge the risk hedged by TW. Once this is accomplished, Enron Corp. 
consolidated hedge documentation needs to be established as a matter of 
urgency; again, we consider this responsibility is best placed in the BU 
using the internal trade as a hedge. In this regard, Ernie (effectiveness 
testing) and I will be available to assist with this documentation.

Please do not hesitate to advise comments or questions on this matter. I am 
preparing the FAS 133 impact 3/31 Pro-Formas based on the identification and 
development of the consolidated hedge documentation.

Roger

My apologies to you left-wingers who may receive this e-mail...

While Al Gore  has a habit of exaggerating his record, these numbers tell
us the real truth  about his record on education, healthcare and taxes:


AL GORE'S  EDUCATION PLANS...

$10,000...? tax deduction that Al Gore says will  be received by "all
students who want to go to college".

$800... tax  deduction is the reality.

0... students working their way through college  getting a tax credit
because they do not pay enough in income  taxes.

30,000,000... low-income households get no benefit on Gore's  education
plan.

0...? families making over $20,000 get a  benefit.

5,000,000... upper income families are ineligible.

0...  deductions or credits for room, board, books, supplies, and travel.

1...  education plan that is almost identical to the one that failed in the
Clinton  White House.


AL GORE'S PROGRAM ON HEALTHCARE:

$600... access  fee per year to obtain prescription drug coverage under the
Gore  plan.

412... new regulatory mandates created by the Gore Medicare  plan.

182... new regulations dealing with prescription drugs  alone.

64.5... the age you are when you have your one and only  opportunity to buy
into a government HMO.

8... year wait for Gore's plan  to be implemented.

2... times the price of Bush's plan to create more  government bureaucrats


THE VICE PRESIDENT ON TAXES:

88...  separate tax increases along with 42 new user fees Gore proposed in
the 2001  budget.

11%... how much the tax burden has increased over the last 8  years.

$500... per child tax credit was never included in previous  Clinton/Gore
budgets.

50,000,000... taxpayers will not get tax relief  under Gore's plan.

$1,400... couples will pay in taxes because Gore  opposed the Marriage
Penalty tax cut.

4.3 cents...? tax increase on  a gallon of gas because of Gore's
tie-breaking vote.


THE MOST  IMPORTANT NUMBERS:

17... days until the election.

PLEASE PASS THIS  ON TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS!

Sincerely,

Jim  Nicholson
Chairman
Republican National Committee

P.S.??  The average Republican has 28 names in his or her email directory -

Tracy,

The West Power desk has been involved in a deal since last July whereby we 
(Power Desk) run a generator for a third party (Harbor Cogen) with gas we 
purchased from the Houston gas desk.  Here is my question....have you ever 
seen an entry booked by the gas desk charging West Power for the gas cost 
because West Power has never recorded this gas cost?!  The gas book name for 
West Power is EPMI West Coast if that helps.

Thanks.

You can get good speaker packages, but many of them are not really good.  
I'll bring some magazines that have articles on some good speaker sets.  You 
can also just put your own package together.  If you do this make sure the 
speakers are of the same brand.  This is what I did for Scott.  Many of the 
speaker packages use  5 small speakers and a sub.  But I suggested larger 
front L&R speakers to Scott for playing music.  Any decent receiver will have 
a decoder built in.  And I do have some brand names, but it really depends on 
how much you are willing to spend.  I'll go through my stash of magazines 
tonight and see what I can find for you to read.

Scott,

Did you buy your surround sound speakers as a package
(left/right/center/surround left/surround right/subwoofer) or did you buy
all the speakers separately.  I would like to buy them all as a package or
maybe all but the subwoofer and buy that separately.  What did you do??  I
have seen some pretty cool JBL Speaker Packages.

Also, what reciever did you get? Even though your DVD player has a decoder
built in, I am assuming that your reciever has a decoder built in also.

Darron, any advice on what brand speakers/receiver etc. and where to get??

IN THE NEWS..."Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,"
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

"It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.


"Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

"Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

"Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

"'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

"When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

"'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

"Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'"

Subject: New Bridge Monitor

This evening, the new improved bridge monitor will be migrated to the EOL 
production environment.  Several new enhancements were created to make this 
application more efficient.  Such as:

1.  The bridge will handle 20 messages/second, instead of processing 1 
message/second.
2.  The screens will no longer jump around! (Yeah)  You can select and view a 
transaction without having the screen update with new deals.
3.  Historical deal query - ability to select and process historical dates 
very quickly.
4.  Sorting capability - you can query any of the eight column headers by 
selecting the column and typing a risk book, trans. id, deal capture system, 
etc. and it  will filter to that section.

Please forward this e-mail to your groups.  If you have any questions or 
concerns with the new bridge monitor please contact me at 3-9353 or Tara at 
3-4523.  We hope this helps, I know it has made our lives easier while 
testing.  Also, feedback is much appreciated!

Thanks,
Dawn

=09
=09 Only three times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985=

1994. Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie (1984) or=
=20
losses (1985 and 1994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four=

losses. =20
=09
=09 In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 1990 and a 10-2=

=09=20

=09
=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l=

season) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There =
is=20
also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th=
e=20
best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20
offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=
=20
us. =20
=09
=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=
est=20
athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=
d=20
players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=
=20
ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=
rt=20
Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and=
=20
play a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a=
nd=20
Hodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20
through the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=
=20
miss in the open field.=20
=09
=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=
back.=20
Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=
=20
probably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc=
e=20
to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=
=20
we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20
slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20
=09 ?? The Jackson residence=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=
 -=20
change coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli=
ng=20
this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=
o=20
much change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to=
=20
this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=
=20
resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=
=20
the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and=
=20
Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=
en=20
lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=
=20
Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=
=20
opponent, Houston.=20
=09
=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =
was=20
that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=
=20
loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=
e=20
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20
could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha=
rd=20
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=
ns=20
are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to=
=20
his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b=
e=20
scrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20

because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=

trend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll=

see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic =

his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20

what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20

=09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20
=09
=09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac=

Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of=

wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=

all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=

run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20
=09
=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=

tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=

linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=
=20
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=

=09
=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=

needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20

=09
=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=
=20
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=
=20
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=
s=20
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=
=20
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=
=20
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=
=20
=09
=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =
was=20
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=
=20
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20
=09
=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=
=20
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=
=20
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=
=20
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=

that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=

=09
=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=

who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=

David, Will and myself have come up with a great team-building idea. We will 
pit all the risk groups against each other in a game of paintball as there 
are a number of people who would enjoy shooting each other with paint guns. I 
have narrowed it down to two possible weekends and need your help in 
identifying which would be the best for your respective groups.  

Option one: October 21 or 22
Option two:  November 18-19

Please report back to me as soon as possible so that I may reserve the 
facility. Thanks

Effective May 6, 2001, New Hire Orientation will go from a day program to 
half a day. The New Hire Orientation will start at 8:00 am and end at 12:00 
pm. The new hires will no longer be given lunch. This change was initiated as 
a result of cost cutting measures. 

We will be distributing the Inside Track at Sally Beck's next staff meeting 
scheduled for 5/14/01. This is an additional tool you can use to integrate 
the employee to your business unit. The Inside Track is a supplement to the 
handouts the new hires receive at orientation. It contains: general 
information, Windows 2000, Microsoft Outlook, PRC process and the business 
unit training expectations. We suggest personally greeting and delivering the 
Inside Track and taking your new hire out to lunch. If this is not possible 
we recommend sending a representative. We feel this would be a great way to 
welcome your new hire to Enron and your business unit. Please contact your 
Human Resources representative if you have any question.

I know this is very late notice, but up until yesterday I didn't think I was

Saturday at Cypress Lakes, which is just off of Hwy 290 at Cypress Rosehill.  
In other words, BFE.  $70 will get you a round of golf, lunch, and beer.  He 
will have a keg.  There will be prizes for the winners.  It is a four man 
best ball scramble.  Tee time is early:  7:30am.  I sent this to guys I 
either know play or think play.  If you have someone else in mind, feel free 
to forward the message.  I don't have a team at all and wanted to see if 
anyone was interested.  Let me know.

I agree.  The honeymoon will be over begining next season.  I am growing 
weary of teams "tricking" us early in games.  Too me, that translates to 
"outcoached".  Maybe I'm being unreasonable, but they should have the talent 
next year.  We'll see.  You had to love OSU kicking the shit out of the 
domers.  Looks like Erickson has brought the thug factor back into college 
football.

Inside of west gas orig we have created a tracking mechanism through Darren,

I understand from Chris Abel that the deals contained within this book were 
transferred to a new book.  Would that be the FT-Lonestar book recently 
created?  If so, did you calc and officialize the book one last time to 
insure that the positions are zeroed out for credit purposes?  If you did 
not, can you please do so.  You can make the effective date the 19th as that 
is the day the deals were moved to a new book.  It necessary for you to calc 
and officialize one last time as the Credit system looks back at the last day 
officialized to pick up credit information.  This will insure that duplicate 
datat is not present for credit.


Thanks for you help in this matter.

Subject: WeaponX

I would like each of your book admins using WeaponX to begin using the 
following procedures at least once/week (if they aren't already).

Open the database while holding down on the shift key.  This will open the 
database, but prevent the main form from opening automatically.  Next, the 
admin should go to Access menu selections and choose Tools/Database 
Utilities/Compact Database.  After the database has completed compacting, you 
can use the database as normal.

Just a quick explanation:

This is standard procedure for Access databases.  WeaponX imports and deletes 
a lot of data on a daily basis.  When data is deleted, the space is not freed 
up that was used by the data.  Therefore, as time goes by, the database size 
grows and grows and needs to be periodically compacted.

The Texas WeaponX file that I compacted reduced from 520 MB to 30 MB and one 
for the west went from 400 MB to 12 MB.  You can see that we will save 
several GB if everyone begins compacting the databases on a regular basis.

Please note:  Even though this is standard Access procedure, I would 
recommend that the book admin save a copy of their existing WeaponX file 
prior to compacting for the first time.  Once the file is compacted and a 
daily run has been successful, they can delete the backup file.  It is not 
necessary for them to save a backup copy each time before compacting.  I am 
only recommending it for the first compact.

I don't anticipate any problems with this procedure.  As a matter of fact, 
Crystal (East desk I believe) already compacts the database on a daily 
basis.  In addition Ann (West desk) ran a test for me with no problems.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Greg

This author of this little story should go to Washington.

"A Republican and a Democrat were walking down the street when they came to
a homeless person. The republican gave the homeless person his business card
and told him to come to his business for a job. He then took twenty dollars
out of his pocket and gave it to the homeless person.

The Democrat was very impressed, and when they came to another homeless
person, he decided to help.
He walked over to the homeless person and gave him directions to the welfare
office. He then reached into the Republican's pocket and gave him fifty
dollars."

It may be hard for some people to figure out the real differences between
Democrats and Republicans, and this little story says it all.

I guess you just summed up the difference between our two programs - at Texas 
we play for National Championships  at LSU you play to make the Sharpie 
Independence bowl.  Yes we were rated in the top 10 at the beginning of the 
year and yes we are rated #20 now.  You forget that we are only half way 
through the season - we will be in the top 10 again before the year is out.  
Where will LSU be?  Besides we weren't supossed to play in the Orange Bowl 
this year ( this is only Mack Brown's 3rd year), but anything less than the 
Rose Bowl nest year will be dissapointing.

See you in Pasadena 2002

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, 
none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton 
Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will 
probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were 
lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.  
Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2 
team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the 
way. 

 Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.  
It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the 
goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).  

 And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to 
back out of that contract a few years back?

See you in the Shreveport.

Final Score 
UT - 58
LSU - 3

Subject: It could happen!!!

There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around! 
After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going 
to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in 
yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball 
(College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year.  
However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football 
nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little 
more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a 
crazy "REEEEEEEE-Verse" play or maybe even a pass on first down.

We can only hope that one of these situations occur!

GEAUX TIGERS!

NEW EMAIL: 
Preliminary Summary Sheets were handed out yesterday afternoon for your 
review.  If needed, the OA group will be more than happy to reclassify 
variances(provided data such as forms, FRED's, etc. were provided by April 
30th) to the correct functional group until Thursday, May 3.

Due to issues which have arisen in the past regarding reclassifying variances 
the day before, or, in some cases, the day of the OA meeting, guidelines are 
being set to avoid the confusion of having multiple copies of the Summary 
Sheets handed out during the monthly meeting.  The final OA packet will be 
delivered on Friday, May 4.  If there are any questions, please feel free to 
call me @ 3-3954.  Thank you.

Jennifer,
The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of 
March compared to February.  That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and 
NGI-PGE CG.  As for IF-CIG WIC, it was also the way the market traded.  Other 
Rocky Mountain points were similar.  Please call if you have any further 
questions.

Subject: March Curve Validation

Darron --

Before I send out the memo for March, I have a few questions about 3 curves 
that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the 
10 curves that were validated for March.  The ones I'm asking you to take a 
look at are:

NGI-MALIN
NGI-PGE CG
IF-CIG WIC

The shifts in MALIN and PGE CG are pretty clear.  For CIG WIC, please note 
how the front years show a price drop compared to prior months, while marks 
in the mid-years have shifted upward by approximately  $0.10.  Thanks for 
your help, and please let me know if you have any questions.


Jennifer

Subject: requests for new curves, new books, porfolio changes

In the past few months, the procedures for setting up new curves and books 
have not been followed by everyone. 

The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set 
up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk 
management (for each commodity group), "risk management"  is responsible for 
ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation 
systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have 
all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of 
RisktRAC).

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of 
this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. 

The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:

Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new 
curve set up
Trader communicates this to risk management
Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT 
department)
Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in 
RisktRAC
Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC
A system generated message is sent to people on the "curve list" indicating a 
change in the RisktRAC curves has been made

If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the 
VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis 
and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new 
curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in 
RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in 
ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.

The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:

Trader/risk management determines new book is needed
New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management
New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC
Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global 
counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and 
counterparty systems
Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is 
sent to personnel on the "books list" and the book administrator in the risk 
management department who requested the book

It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC 
books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per 
ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).

The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.  
Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio 
hierarchies.  The procedure now is:

Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy 
changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk 
Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to 
submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management.
Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested 
change in structure
Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management 
that the change has been made.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please call: me X39123, 
Chris Abel X33012, Burton McIntyre X57197, or Susan Trevino X31462.

Thanks,

Shona

Make sure your group is looking out for this.  

1. If copying post ids to run mini books they need to take the TDS flag off
2.  Since not everyone will do #1 - they should watch their position loads to 
make sure they are bringing in the correct post ids (they are listed in the 
load statement)   After they have closed this screen there isn't a way of 
seeing this.


Note I have changed working hours & currently come during lunch.  If you have

Russ Severson.

Bill:

The PortCalc screen has been changed in production to copy the TDS position 
load flag as is,
instead of setting it to 0.

It seems after some discussion the prevailing wisdom is to change the way the 
TDS flag works when copying a Post ID.

Risk would like to have the TDS flag copy to new Post IDs.  

Please make the change when possible.  I would put the Meta Calc having the 
flag a higher priority.

Thanks,

Bill

The TDS position load flag has been added to the PortCalc screen in
production. Please close your PortCalcs screens and bring up new ones 
to access this feature.

(The field is labelled TDS, and is located in the middle, left side of the 
screen.)

Thank you,

Jeremy Wong will be moving the TDS position load flag onto the Port Calc 
screen Thursday morning.  

Kenny Ha will then move the new release of TDS to use this flag into 
production Thursday night.  

Risk will have to flag their books with the new flag Thursday night so the 
trader positions will load correctly into TDS for Friday.  I will talk to 
everyone about the change on Thursday & send out a notice of other changes.

As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) 
project status:

?  TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
?  TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be 
presented to the traders. 
?  Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV 
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's 
reports.
?  We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early 
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to 
publish their region's reports.
?   At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the 
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region 
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
?  Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review 
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and 
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production 
environment.

Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and 
support on this initiative!  Please let me know if you have any questions.

need to put EOL as the system of origin and the EOL number.  Thanks.

Prior to her trip to Texas, Buffy (a New Yorker) confided to her
sorority sisters she had three goals for her trip to the Lone Star
State.
She wanted to taste some real Texas Bar B Que, take in a bona fide
rodeo and
have sex with a cowboy.  Upon her return, her sorority sisters
were
curious as to how she fared.

Let me tell you, they have a tree down there called mesquite and
when  they slow cook that brisket over that mesquite, oh so
good!!!!
The taste is unbelievable!!!  I went to a real rodeo. Talk about
athletes,
these guys wrestle  real full-grown bulls- like in Spain.  Except
they
ride a horse out at full gallop, then jump off the horses and
literally
grab the bulls by the horns  and throw them to the ground.  It is
incredible!
They then asked, " Well tell us, did you have sex with a cowboy?"
Are you kidding?  Once I saw the outline of the condom they carry
around
in the back pocket of their jeans, I changed my mind!!!!





                 


NEW EMAIL: 
Susan,

Attached is the completed book request form.  I just want to clarify a few 
things.  The first three books are for Tagg.  The last two are for Sitara.  I 
will need a region set up in CPR to hold the physical deals.  Do you do 
this?  Or can you point me in the right direction.  I really need this 
completed by the end of the week.  Let me know if there is something else I 
need to do.  Thanks for your help.

Thanks for the list of existing transactions.  Only one question, it looks 
like the list includes only the different corporate entities of NICOR.  Does 
that mean that there were no existing transactions with the other Corporate

NEW EMAIL: 
Is it really necessary to change the book names just to avoid confusion?  Who 
is confused?  Can't we just inform those who need to know that the Denver 
books are simply another desk that rolls up into the West Region?  I don't 
want to be difficult, but it will require a great deal of time and effort to 
change every deal in the Denver books to a new name.  Let me know what you 
think.

Subject: Denver FT and IM books

As part of the Doorstep project, (internal audit) it has become apparrent 
that we should rename the Denver trading books in order to avoid confusion in 
regards to who manages the risk in those books.  Since we have completed the 
transfer of those books to Houston and Jay is now managing those books I 
think it is appropriate to remove Denver from the title so people outside of 
the West Group don't think we are trading in Denver.  Of course we will 
continue to support Jay in whatever he needs and provide the middle market 
and origination coverage to the customers associated with the deals in this 
book.

Let me know if anyone has any concerns regarding this and Shona Wilson can 
make the name changes if we let her know what name to change it to.

Mark

Believe me, I understand why you want him in your group.  But I lose Jennifer 
on Jan 24th and Chris on Jan 26th.  You have two months on one guy and six on 
the other.  I have 3 weeks on two people and Jason will be leaving soon 
because he is in the new trading track program.  I don't want to be an 
asshole, but I won't give him up unless I'm forced to.

6 months and Jody is rotating in two months.  I will help you find more 
talent.  What do you think?

Once you have reviewed, please forward your changes to Darron Giron.  He will

What do you think about us starting to workout together regularly?  Either at 
night or in the mornings, but regularly and for the long term.  Maybe four 
times a week.  Running and some weights in the garage.  I would really like 
to start, even as hard as it will be, to make time for something like this.  
I love you.

It's no big deal, but I still can't see Kristi's IRA online.  I also don't 
receive statements in the mail for the account.  It looks as if the automated

Thanks for your help.  I need to use this tomorrow.

NEW EMAIL: 
First of all, congrats on the big win this weekend.  They keep proving me 
wrong.  Second, sorry this is late.  Friday was 1st day, our longest of the 
month.

   DRAFT

This is a summary of where we stand from a Risk Management perspective on the 
PGT/Socal permanent assignment to Calpine  Currently there are 5 deals in 
Tagg and 1 in the transport  model.

 EC3952.O - Annuity where the West desk pays PGT (from $.08987 to $.17308) on 
67,500/Day thru Oct-23
 This deal will be unwound and this income (approx $30M) will fall out in the 
West desk

 EC3952.F - Buy from Canada of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + 
$.00
 EC3952.K - Sell to AEC of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + $.00
 As of now, these deals will remain unchanged in the system because AEC will 
not let us out of the firm contract

 EC2208.B - Buy from Canada of 22,500/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index - 
$.005
 EC3952.B - Buy from Canada of 15,000/Day thru Oct-01 at Malin for Index - 
$.01
 These deals will be unwound, but discussions between Philip Allen and ??? 
will reveal details not known at this point in time   (Bid/Offer)

 Transport Model - Kingsgate to Malin capacity of 67,500/Day beginning Nov-08 
thru Oct-23
 This deal will have to be unwound or killed - Currently the deal is valued 
at approx $12M in the West Desk

After unwinding these deals, the West desk will be kept whole, the remainder 
will be granted out in orig.

This is my first go at it.  Let me know of any revisions you want.

NEW EMAIL: 
Sean,
I found out that Silver Creek is a very small resort close to the town of 
Granby, CO.  It is acutally 15 miles north of Winter Park and 2 miles south 
of Granby along Hwy 40.  We are staying at a condo there from Sunday night 
(11th) thru Thursday night (15th).  I indicated we would like to go to Winter 
Park because we have been there and it is close.  We want to ski 2 days in 
Silver Creek and 2 days somewhere else.  If you can make it during the week 
to Keystone, then yes we will go there instead of WP.  I would love to go to 
an Avs game, but we will probably need to be on the road by late afternoon on 
Sunday.

Once again, we get in on Saturday (10th) about 9pm.  That's pretty late so we 
may or may not be able to do anything that night.  We will leave on Sunday 
(11th) for Silvercreek and be back in Denver at your place on Friday (16th).  
Then our plane back to Houston is early Saturday (17th) morning.  If you can 
get away during the week to ski, that would be awesome.  Thanks for all your 
hospitality.  See you soon.

DG

The weather is great here.  In March, we receive every type of weather.  One
day we could get 12 inches of snow, the next day it could be 80!  I have a
pass to Keystone, Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek, and A-Basin.  My pass
does not include Winter Park (although I have a free lift ticket that I
could use and go skiing with you.).  My pass cost $300 and I get unlimited
use (I have been 23 times this year-I think I got my money worth!).  I do
not know where Silvercreek is, but I will look. Do you mean Silverthorne by
chance?  If there is any way to go to Keystone, it would save Tracie and I
some money.  But, I understand that it is your vacation and if you go to
Winter Park, let me know and price is no concern.  This is how I rank the
resorts as far as skiing: 1. Vail  2. Copper  3. Keystone  4. Winter
Park/Mary Jane  5. Breckenridge.

I have not been to Beaver Creek, but I heard that it was awesome.  Even
though I ranked WP fourth, it is still a great resort.  The runs at Keystone
and Vail are long and Vail is the largest resort in USA (5300 acres compared
to 2000 for Keystone!).  As far as atmosphere (night life), Vail is by far
the best.  Winter Park does not have much at the ski resort as far as night
life (that I recall, but I have not been there much.).  You have to go into
town, which is small.  Breckenridge is good for the night as well and so is
Copper, but Vail is the best (I love Vail if you have not noticed!).  Just
let me know as far as plans.  We have a busy March.  On March 17, the day
you leave, we have a wedding.  On Friday night, we might have to go to the
rehearsal dinner, but I do not know yet.  Michelle and the kids are coming
up in March also.  Maybe she can come up at the same time.  We always have a
room available.

I am looking forward to seeing you and Kristi.  Let me know if you guys want
to do anything in Denver.  You can also go snowmobiling and snowshoeing as
well.

If you guys need any ski gear or accessories, let me know and I will check
here for prices.  Plus, you can borrow some of my gear on the days I can't
meet up with you.

You guys are going to love it here.  You also need to come out in the
summertime.  It is so much better.  I think my sisters and dad are coming
out again for the 4th of July.  We went white water rafting last year and
Kim loved it.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Sean

Gary and I are going to have a "get together" before the Holiday Party on 
Saturday, December 9th.  Please let me know if you want to stop by our place 
before we head out to Enron Field.  We live really only a few miles away from 
downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in 
the "burbs"!   (No names mentioned).  

Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and I will give you directions 
to our place.  Hope all of you can make it!

Thanks,
Dawn

As discussed in the brown bag classes today many people would like to be able 
to see the NYMEX prices updated in real-time.  Attached is a modified TDS 
file that will listen to the NYMEX price.  When you open the file an error 
message appears but the file does work.  Just go to the listen page and you 
can see each of the months.  Please forward this file to your group if you 
feel it will be useful to them.  If you have any questions just ask.

NEW EMAIL: 
I just looked at their sight.  They seem like a reputable company.  It's a 
store in Manhattan, NY.  The only thing to be concerned about when ordering 
by phone or online is when there is a problem with the unit.  It is more of a 
pain in the ass to mail it back than to just take it to Circuit City or Best 
Buy.  But a Sony DVD is very reliable and you should not have a problem.  I'd 
pull the trigger, that's a great price.

Darron,

I am ready to purchase the Sony C670D DVD Player.  I have gone thru CNET.com
and found a three star (highest rating) certified CNET dealer that sells it
for $340  - Tweeter has it for $449 + tax and Circuit City and Best Buy
don't carry this model.  The name of the Internet company is
moreaudiovideo.com.

Did you order yours off the internet and if so from whom?  I am a little
weary about buying something like this off the internet...

Subject: Deals in the MGMT-WEST book

Hi Darron,

I'm not sure if this message is to go to you, and if it needs to go to 
someone else could you please forward it to them, but there are several deals 
in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book in 
the morning.  

Q88422.1
Q87046.1
Q87271.1
Q87419.1
Q92337.1
QB4026.1
QB4210.1
QB4991.1
QB5037.1
QB5039.1
QB5129.1
Q87016.1

These are all December deals with companies that ECC has master swaps with, 
and I should be settling them all on Friday December 8th.  Could you please 
make sure that there aren't any more deals with ECC and a third counterparty 
in this book as it messes up invoicing and settlement.

Please call me if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for your help
Stacey

Bill,

I need to have FT-DENVER set up in TDS.  The trader is Jay Reitmeyer.  There 
are two Tagg books that need to be mapped to this:  FT-DENVER and 
INTRA-DENVER.  The following people in Risk need access to the book:  Darron 
Giron, Chris Walker, Pat Ryder, Jason Wolfe, Carole Frank, Anne Bike, and 
Jennifer Bagwell.  I also want it to roll up into ALL-WEST.  Call me if you 
have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

To set up the Denver desk in TDS send a message to Bill Fortney with the 
following:

What to call it in TDS (it can be different than TAGG)
The names of the TAGG books to map to it
Who needs access
A roll up desk if needed.  Does it need to be added to ALL-WEST, have a 
different roll up or doesn't need a roll-up desk at all.

Any questions give me a call x5-7579 or Bill Fortney x3-9952

Subject: Killing physical deals

We have had a few recent instances where deals have been unwound in TAGG and 
not in Sitara.  This, has,  in all cases resulted in a negative financial 
impact.  Going forward,  no long-term physical deals will be unwound without 
my signature,  and that of the physical trader responsible for trading the 
area for which the deal was done.  Also,  all unwind tickets will require  
the old TAGG and Sitara deal number to be written on the ticket.

Subject: Liquidation Oct 2000

Darron,

For Oct 2000 I found a Liquidation amount in the Central region for The 
Peoples Gas Light & Coke......$336,234.06
Yet, I show no transactions for them in that region.  I looked in tagg - deal 
capture and for the tagg numbers listed
in the detail OA-liquidation spreadsheet (N17872.1   N17872.2   N18064.1   
N18064.2), I either saw no "comments",
or there was a comment referring to a "North Shore Baseload sale".

Would you please assist me or direct me to the person who would be familiar 
with this.
I am placing copies of the documents referred to above, on your desk.

Thanks for you help.

Doug

Subject: Canadian deals in US books.

Just a quick request for you to go into all your books to make sure that 
there are no ECC deals booked there.  If there are any that are with 
counterparties other than RISKMANTRA, they need to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  Invoicing for November should 
start today, and both ECC and ENA are held back from invoicing until these 
deals are fixed, as the deals will be invoiced by the wrong Enron 
counterparty if they aren't.  If you could please let me know when the deals 
have been fixed, I can let the accounting department in Houston know when 
they can start invoicing as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this matter.

Thank you
Stacey

Good to get a message from you even tho I am pretty far away!!  I will check

cousins on Sunday and one of my first cousins is taking me around tonite for
a while.  Last nite I went on a twilight tour until 11:30.  The monuments
are so outstanding especially at night. Hope you can take your family
here...Chris would be in so much awe.  Glad you had a good time with Carlos.
I will talk to you this weekend.  Love, MOM

I wanted to see if the address worked.  We had a good time in NO.  We
definitely want to go back.  It was really crowded, but fun.  The weather
was good and the food was great.  How is DC?  Have you seen any of the
sights yet?

I wanted to ask if you can help with C&C on the 16th and 17th of May when
we are in Chicago.  I know your schedule just got alot more hectic, so let
me know.  They can stay in Conroe on Fri and Sat.  We leave Wed night and
return Sun morning.  It would mean be staying at our house on those nights
and getting them to school.  If you can't, we will try to get one of the
neighbors.

Thanks.  See you when you get back.

Shelly,

I am looking for an Analyst to fill a position in Gas Risk Management.  I am 
the West Desk Controller and report to Jeff Gossett.  I think a Book 
Administrator role is a good position for an Analyst.  We have had success in 
with Analysts in our group.  I think it presents a good opportunity for them 
as well.  Please let me know how I can get on a list to talk with potential 
candidates.  I am ignorant of the process, so if I am presuming something 
incorrect, I would appreciate info on how this is supposed to work.  Thanks 
for your help.

NEW EMAIL: 
I asked Keith Holst (trader) again.  His answer was the same.  There were 
more buyers than sellers in the West during March, hence the price was 
stronger.  Thanks.

Subject: Re: March Curve Validation  

Darron --

Thanks for your response.  We understand that the west traded higher in 
general during March v. Feb,  as evidenced by the data.  However, we are 
looking for specific reasons as to why this is so.  For example, if the 
market was more volatile at these locations, then why?  What particular 
market conditions sparked large price changes, etc?  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jennifer

Jennifer,
The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of 
March compared to February.  That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and 
NGI-PGE CG.  As for IF-CIG WIC, it was also the way the market traded.  Other 
Rocky Mountain points were similar.  Please call if you have any further 
questions.

Darron --

Before I send out the memo for March, I have a few questions about 3 curves 
that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the 
10 curves that were validated for March.  The ones I'm asking you to take a 
look at are:

NGI-MALIN
NGI-PGE CG
IF-CIG WIC

The shifts in MALIN and PGE CG are pretty clear.  For CIG WIC, please note 
how the front years show a price drop compared to prior months, while marks 
in the mid-years have shifted upward by approximately  $0.10.  Thanks for 
your help, and please let me know if you have any questions.

This is a fun diversion.

Take this test for yourself...and send it to your friends, including me, and
let them know who you are. My score is in the subject box... Don't peek but
begin the test as you scroll down and answer.

Answers are for who you are now...not who you were in the past.   Have pen

It's only 10 simple questions, so...  Grab a pencil and paper, keeping track

Now add up the total number of points.
OVER 60 POINTS:
Others see you as someone they should "handle with
care." You're  seen
as
vain, self-centered, and who is extremely dominant.
Others may admire
you,
wishing they could be more like you, but don't always
trust you,
hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.




 51 TO 60 POINTS:
Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather
impulsive
personality; a natural leader, who's quick to take
decisions,  though not
always the  right ones. They see you as bold and
adventuresome, someone
who will try anything once; someone who takes chances
and enjoys an
adventure.  They enjoy being in your company because
of the excitement you
radiate.

41 TO 50 POINTS:
Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing,
practical, and
always interesting; someone who's constantly in the
center of attention,
but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to
their head. They also
see you as kind, considerate, and understanding;
someone who'll always
cheer  them up and help them out.

31 TO 40 POINTS:
Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful &
practical. They see you
as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest... Not a
person who makes
friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's
extremely loyal to
friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in
return. Those who
really get to  know you realize it takes a lot to
shake your trust in your
friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to
get over it if
that trust is ever broken.

21 TO 30 POINTS:
Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They
see you as very
cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady
plodder. It'd really
surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or
on the spur of the
moment,  expecting you to examine everything carefully
from every angle
and then, usually decide against it. They think this
reaction is caused
partly by your careful nature.

UNDER 21 POINTS:
People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive,
someone who needs
looking after, who always wants someone else to make
the decisions & who
doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything.
They see you as a
worrier who always sees problems that don't exist.
Some people think
you're boring. Only those who know you well know that
you aren't.

Now forward this on to everyone you know, making sure
to put YOUR score
in the subject box.

Jay,

I changed the FTS monthly amount from $1,065 to $715 as previously 
discussed.  It is effective Feb 20th.  I need to change the amount 
transferred to account  586-61L86 from $150 to $175 and to account 586-61M19 
from $175 to $200.  I also submitted a transfer of $1,000 into my CMA 
account.  I would like to transfer $500 each into account 586-94017 and 
account 586-94019.  This is my 2001 contribution to the Education IRA's.  Let 
me know if I need to do anything else.  Also, when are the 
recharacterizations from Roth to Traditional going to take place?  I will 
need a 1099-R for the transactions I think.  Call me if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

Hi guys,

I've come across this deal that needs to be flipped right away.
This deal is in the MGMT-WEST book with Aquila Canada Corp. and
ENA.  It needs to be in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book settling between
ECC and Aquila Canada Corp.  This is causing problems with the 
February Liquidations as I settled this deal with Aquila, but it isn't coming
through the liquidations correctly.  Please let me know when this is done
so I can let Shannon McPearson know that she needs to re-run the 
February Liquidations.

Thanks

Administrator role is a good position for an Analyst.  We have had success in 
with Analysts in our group.  I think it presents a good opportunity for them 
as well.  Please let me know how I can get on a list to talk with potential 
candidates.  I am ignorant of the process, so if I am presuming something

????????A shepherd was herding his flocks in a remote pasture when 
suddenly a brand new Jeep Cherokee advanced out of a dust cloud towards him. 
The 
driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and a 
YSL 
tie leaned out of the window and asked our shepherd: "If I can tell you 
exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?" 

The shepherd looks at the yuppie, then at his peacefully grazing flock and 
calmly answers "sure!" 
The yuppie parks the car, whips out his notebook, 
connects it to a cell-phone, surfs to a NASA page on the Internet where he 
calls 
up a GPS satellite navigation system, scans the area, opens up a database and 
some 60 Excel spreadsheets with complex formulas. Finally he prints out a 150 
page report on his hi-tech miniaturized printer, turns round to our shepherd 
and 
says: "You have here exactly 1,586 sheep!" 

"This is correct. As agreed, you can take one of the sheep" says the 
shepherd. He watches the young man make a selection and bundle it in his 
Cherokee. 

Then he says: "If I can tell you exactly what your business is, 
will you give me my sheep back?" 

"Okay, why not" answers the young man. "You are a consultant" says the 
shepherd. 

"This is correct" says the yuppie, "How did you guess that?" 

"Easy" answers the shepherd. "You turn up here although nobody called 
you. You want to be paid for the answer to a question I already knew the 
solution to. And you don't know shit about my business--? you took my dog."

Elizabeth:

Darin Giron called me about the EOL park and loan deal from Friday. These 
deals will cause differences with your EOL-Sitara reconciliation. The EOL 
deal will error out in Spreadsheet - Natural Gas, therefore you won't see it 
erroring out under Sitara. The EOL Park and Loan deal should be booked as 
four deals in Sitara. These Park and Loan deals should be booked as two 
exchange deals (one receipt and one delivery) between ENA and the third 
party. And then two desk to desk deals between ENA and EMW. The EOL deal 
number should be referenced on both of the exchange deals. Darin booked EOL 
deal 330098 as two physical forwards (348347 and 348364) and two desk to 
desks (348362 and 348375). He is going to create the two exchange deals and 
kill the two physical forwards and reference the EOL deals numbers on the 
exchange deals. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

A W4 calculates how much federal tax is withheld from your paycheck each pay 
period.  There are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing 
status.  The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld.  Married 
and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.  There 
is really no right or wrong answer, only opinion.  If you want more withheld 
each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on 
April 15th, then claim fewer dependents and married and seperately.  If you 
don't want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you 
may owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim a higher number of dependents and 
married and jointly.  I hope that made sense.

Subject: RE: Star VPP

Met with Pam and here is the deal.  Pam wants the P&L for the April deals to 
show up in May GL.  What I suggested to her was that rather than do anything 
for the deals in risk or Portfolio that Pam defer the P&L on her company and 
release it the next month.  This keeps things normal in our worlds and Pam 
controls when she sees the P&L on her company.  She has agreed to do this.

There will be a new twist starting in July.  Starr is supposed to become 3rd 
party and the payment date is supposedly two months after the fact.  Pam is 
checking with legal to see if there is to be a complete unwind and rebooking 
because of structure changes to make the deal 3rd party or if we can just 
change the counterparty on the deals.  I'm sure we will be the last to know 
as usual.

I can't believe it either.  I just accepted a new job, so unfortunately
I don't think I can take any time off.  I am going to try and leave
early Friday.  I'm still testing out the waters over here in my new
group.  I am free in the evenings so I will plan on coming over to
dad's.  I would invite you all to stay at my house, but I don't have any
beds in the bedrooms!  I just moved in and am in the process of
furnishing.  What time are you coming in on Thursday?  Dad and I can
come up with some fun things for you all to do during the day.

We haven't purchased tickets for the game on Saturday.  We were thinking
we could just buy them the day of the game.  Shouldn't be a sell out!
I'm sure KU will lose.  Michelle's family is all excited about going to
the game Saturday.

I'm looking forward to seeing you all.  It's going to be a little cold
so be sure to bring warm clothes!

Kevin,

I just wanted to mention a few things.  I'm sure you are doing them already 
most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.

Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field
Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in 
Tagg
Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg
Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal
Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for 
every EOL deal
Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, 
just let me know and I'll follow up.

Thanks.

Attached is the original churn that was submitted, the night that this was 
supposed to happen your people
were not able to switch the monitors out due to Bid - Week which is the 
busiest time of the month and my 
person was still working.  The person who came to move the monitors said that 
they would come back on
Monday or Tuesday and here it is Wednesday and nothing has been done.  If you 
could update me with some
type of information as far as when this will be taken care of that would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

> Jim Lehrer: Welcome to the second presidential debate
> between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush.
> The candidates have agreed on  these rules: I will ask a question.
> The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed
> remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters.
>
> The opponent will then have one minute to respond by
> trying to frighten senior citizens into voting for him. When a
> speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly while he
> continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three
> more minutes.
>
> Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you
> give us the name of a downtrodden citizen and then tell us
> his or her story in a way that strains the bounds of common
> sense?
>
> Gore: As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made
> love the way we have so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid
> marriage, the downtrodden have a clear choice in this election.
>
> My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest 1 percent of
> Americans. I, on the other hand, want to put the richest 1 percent in
> an ironclad lockbox so they can't hurt old people like Roberta
> Frampinhamper, who is here tonight.
>
> Mrs. Frampinhamper has been selling her internal organs, one by one,
> to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify
> problems for me. Also, her poodle has arthritis.
>
> Lehrer: Gov. Bush, your rebuttal.
>
> Bush: Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people,
> crying with them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity
> exists.
>
> I want to empower those crying people to make their own
> decisions, unlike my opponent, whose mother is not Barbara Bush.
>
> Lehrer: Let's turn to foreign affairs. Gov. Bush, if Slobodan
> Milosevic were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia,
> would you be able to pronounce his name?
>
> Bush: The current administration had eight years to deal with that
> guy and didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would
> do about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies. And
> then Dick would present me several options for dealing with that guy.
> And then Dick would tell me which one to choose. You know, as
> governor of Texas, I have to make tough foreign policy decisions
> every day about how we're going to deal with New Mexico.
>
> Lehrer: Mr. Gore, your rebuttal.
>
> Gore: Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly
> interested in. I served my country in Vietnam. I had an uncle who
> was a victim of poison gas in World War I. I myself lost a leg in the
> Franco-Prussian War. And when that war was over, I came
> home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way that any undecided
> woman voter would find romantic.
> If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal
> knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in
> an ironclad lockbox. Because the American people deserve a president
> who can comfort them with simple metaphors.
>
> Lehrer: Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security
> system?
>
> Gore: It's a vital issue, Jim. That's why Joe Lieberman and I have
> proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000
> to every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a
> single penny until the year 2250.
> In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion over the next 10 years to
> guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to
> their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help
> them with the child-proof cap.
>
> Lehrer: Gov. Bush?
>
> Bush: That's fuzzy math. I know, because as governor of Texas, I have
> to do math every day. I have to add up the numbers and decide whether
> I'm going to fill potholes out on Rt. 36 east of Abilene or commit
> funds to reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds.
>
> Lehrer: It's time for closing statements.
>
> Gore: I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, but
> I will fight for the working families of America, in addition to
> turning the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper
> and me.
>
> Bush: It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing
> no one but Republicans.
> Lehrer: Good night.

sling shots in the future.

Darron,

When you are manually entering the EMW deals into tagg, are you referencing 
the EOL number?  

I was looking at the tagg deal you gave me last Friday (Q40121) and it does 
not reference it.  Should it?  Or, because it is funky, does it not have to?

I want to run something by you.  It sounds like we have some sort of budget 
for Friday night.  I would like to offer everyone the opportunity to bring 
someone with them but also explain that we may not be able to pay for it 
all.  I guess the reason is I would like to have Kristi come with me, but am 
willing to pay for her.  I would like to do the same for everyone else, but 
don't want to offend anyone with the possibility that they may have to pay a 
little $$.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Subject: Synthetic Storage Liquidation Variances

Darron,

I am going to try to put my thoughts on paper, but call me if there are any 
further questions...

For April, we have 1,390,618 of expense on the back page.  I have narrowed it 
down to the following...
 Tagg #N06517 being double booked  $952,500  (the correct tagg # is N08646).  
 The other side of the storage transaction is in 9/00 physical liquidation 
file and it is for 1,866,000.
 Looks like double booking it actually made us money. Check it out though!
 
 137,000 in liquidations should have been moved to commodity expense to cover 
transportations
 OA, but it wasn't., so we this is income for us.

 Two deals were booked in sitara but not tagg and, therefore, no liquidation 
to cover the expenses.
 They are sitara #242510 and #128336.  The total of these equaled 429,477.  

For May, we have 1,889,707 in income on the back page.  This comes from:
 Another deal booked twice....Tagg #N05499 was booked as duplicate (the right 
one is #N08617)
 The other side (expense) of the deal was taken in Dec.99. Therefore, I see 
this as true income!
 
 Tagg #NJ4479, I will have to talk with you about this.  I don't fully 
understand it myself.

 93,924 (Tagg #NG0049), this should have been transferred to 3rd party 
sales/purchases.
 This storage deal is booked directly with the third party.

I have not looked at July in full, but have some print outs to give you.

Please let me know if you have any further questions on this crap!  I am just 
a phone call away.

Dawn

Darin - Great talking with you.

Mail the check to 11621 Rydalwater Lane, Austin, TX 78754-5720.

You wanted two season tix at $195 each and 4 OU tix at $55 each for a total
of $610.  I take it you didn't want any other individual game tickets.  (I
forgot to ask).

We'll find out about the OU tix in late August/early September.  If we
don't get them, we'll get a refund.

We arrive in Denver on Saturday evening (the 10th).  We will stay that night 
and leave sometime on Sunday for Silvercreek.  We will return to Denver on 
Friday the 16th and stay the night.  Our plane back to Houston is early 
Saturday morning.  We are staying at a place in Silvercreek (I had not heard 
of this place before Kristi's friends made the plans) for 5 nights.  I think 
we want to ski there and possibly in Winter Park (it is supposed to be within

George, we need a new trade zone added for a new pipe (Wildhorse Energy

The scheduler is Jaqueline Adams at X33918.  She agrees that the trade zone 
can be the same as the pipe code.

Please let me know as soon as this zone is added, so that I may get started 
on added all the meters.

Hello, Young People.....
?
Still planning on the KU/UT game next weekend, I  hope.? If you are flying 
in, you can get?from the airport, about 30-35  miles, without hitting a 
traffic light until the last mile or so.
?
FROM THE AIRPORT:
1.? Exit the airport toward Kansas City on  I-29 South.? When you get to
2.??I-635, go South; probably will be  marked to "Wichita" or maybe Kansas 
City.? When you get to
3.??I-35, go South again.? You will  be somewhere around 50th street.? Street 
numbers increase as you go  south.
4.? After 75th Street stay in the right lane  and take Hiway 69 South.
5.? Stay on Hiway 69; after 119th Street it  will curve left and then right.? 
After the right hand curve, the road  merges with another highway.? Stay in 
the extreme right lane  and
6.? Exit at 135th street.? Exit to the  right and stay in the right lane 
until the first light; (Antioch).? (About  half mile).
7.? Turn right at Antioch (first light) and  get into the left lane.
8.? Short block to the first light; this is  133rd Street; turn left.
9.? Go to the second right; this is  Kessler.? Turn right on Kessler.
10.? Take the immediate left onto 132nd  Place.? Go to second house on right; 
not counting the house on the  corner.? The address is 9210.
?
After you leave the airport, the exits onto I-29  and then onto I-35 come a 
little quickly, so watch for the signs.?  I expect to be home all weekend.? 
But, if I  am out, the garage door keypad combination is "0730".? Make 
yourselves at  home and help yourselves to anything that is not tied or 
nailed down or  hazardous.? My phone number is (913) 402-9210; cell phone is 
(913)  269-6247.? Not necessary to dial the area code once you get into  
Kansas.? From the airport (Missouri) you'll need the area  code.
?
If you're driving, exit I-35 in Olathe at Exit  215.? Turn right and go about 
4.5 miles to Switzer (school on left; park on  right).? Left on Switzer to 
first right (133rd Street).? Right on  133rd to second left (Kessler).? Left 
on Kessler; left on 132nd Place to  house.? Let me know when you expect to 
arrive and then depart and maybe we  can line something up to keep you busy 
while you're here.? Sean and Tracie  will be in San Antonio that weekend, and 
Mike and Christine can't make it, but  Michelle and her gang and Kim are 
anxious to see you again.? See you  soon......Clark.

I'm with you.  I told my wife I thought it would be a 3 touchdown game, but a 
49 point margin is unacceptable.  I was at the game and it was as if the 
Texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put 
together a game plan on Saturday morning before kickoff.  They were out of 
position, slow, unmotivated, and flat out not prepared to play.  I like Brown 
and actually think he is a good fit, but at some point you actually have to 
coach.  I lay this all at his feet.  Obviously the coordinators bear some 
major responsibility as well.  I really don't know what to expect for the 
remainder of the season.  They obviously are not as bad as they showed on 
Saturday.  But the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly 
on any Saturday, and I really did not think that with this defense they could 
be humiliated.  I was very wrong.  Something has to change.  The fact is they 
are 3-5 in the last 8 games.  And were favored in all but one.  Lack of 
talent is no longer an excuse.  I think the entire remainder of the season 
hinges on this Saturday.  If they play as poorly as they have all season 
(they have beaten 3 terrible teams, and lost to a bad one) against Colorado, 
they will lose and I could see them finishing at 6-5 and even 5-6 not out of 
the question.  For this reason, I think that this could be the biggest game 
of Brown's tenure at UT.  What do you think?

NEW EMAIL: 
A W4 calculates how much federal tax to withhold from your paycheck each pay 
period.  There are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing 
status.  The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld.  Married 
and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.  There 
is really no good or bad answer, only opinion.  If you want more withheld 
each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on 
April 15th, then claim more dependents and married and jointly.  If you don't 
want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you may 
owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim fewer dependents and married and 
seperately.  I hope that made sense.

Hey Scott T -  I was just up on 19 funny knowing you're right above me.
   They just sent me down a new W4 to fill out - do you know if its better
to
   file married and jointly or married and separately? How do I find out.
You
   know Mr. Scharck doesnt have a clue and Im not really sure either.
   Thanks for the idea about the DVD player - thats what he is getting and
Mike
   told me to get The Patriot, Matrix and Fight Club - Big George is
driving up
   with Drew, Chris Melber, Ross etc on Friday and he is going to take it
for me
   - so you don't have to mess with it.

   Ciao, Lester

Sean,

How's CO?  I hope you are doing well.  I know I have asked you before, but I 
seem to have accidentally deleted your dad and sister's email addresses.  I 
want to ask you dad if he will be in town when KU plays Texas later in 
November.  I want to bring the whole family.  If you get a chance, shoot me a 
message with his info.  My mom is vacationing in NY so I can't ask her.  
Thanks.

Per our conversation, please advise as to what GD index Enron would use to

Cove Point - I think it is in Maryland.  Acquired from CES
National Fuel -
Tennessee - which of the many indices
Napoleonville - 
Transco - which of the many indices


Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.  I need this for

I am working on OA for phase II Dec prod.  It looks like there are 
liquidations on the buy side that equal the variance on the sales side for 
the above ref counterparty.  Look at NW9561.2 and NX4842.2.  Is it okay to 
assume that these liquidations belong on the  purchase side.  This is for the 
west region.


Call if you have questions.

Thanks!

Jeff,
I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us 
involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking 
deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last 
one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small 
and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I 
think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in 
preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is 
easier said than done.

Found this on a web site.


The Gelaendewagen or "G-wagen" is something of a Land Rover on steroids with 
German engineering. 
Think of a cross between an S500 sedan and the Hummer. At $135,000 a copy and 
with only a handful being 
imported into the US, those lucky enough to get their hands on a G-Wagen are 
assured exclusivity and an 
all-terrain vehicle that means business.

Kevin,

Doing some more month end clean up.  

I received an invoice from Peoples Gas to ENA for $5,000.  The description is:

For Summer-Winter Exchange Agreement between Peoples and ENA from June 1,2000 
through July 31,200 for 1Bcf.

1 Bcf Program Original Hedge:  1,000,000 MMBtu x .005 = $5,000

I cannot find a Sitara deal for this amount.  Will you please look into 
this?  They told me the deal maker is Richard Tomaski.

If you send me your fax number I'll send you a copy of the invoice.

Thanks,
Kevin

Actually, I also remember that it is composed of the first three letters of

we're getting old.

Darron,  I saw two or three software manager and an IT
manager positions at the Enron web site.  They look like
something I might be interested in doing if everything
could work out.  Can we talk about Enron when you return?

Texas Baby 

A Texan buys a round of drinks for all in  the bar?because, he announces
his wife has just produced "a typical  Texas baby boy weighing 25 pounds."
Congratulations shower him from all  around, and many?exclamations of
"Wow!" are heard. A woman faints due  to?sympathy pains 

Two weeks later, he returns to the bar. The  bartender?says, "Say,
you're the father of the typical Texas  baby?that weighed 25 pounds at
birth. How much does he weigh now?"  

The proud father answers, "Seventeen pounds." 

The bartender is  puzzled, concerned. "Why? What?happened? He already
weighed 25 pounds at  birth." 

The Texas father takes a slow swig from his long-neck?Lone  Star, wipes
his lips on his shirtsleeve, leans into?the bartender and  proudly
says,? "Had him circumcised."

Andrea,

Is it possible to get a list of first year analysts who graduated in December 
to interview for my group?  I don't know how the process works, but I would 
like to hire a candidate just out of college if possible.  Thanks for your 
help.

Jennifer,

NGI-PGE/TOPOCK is an internal curve used to value transport and is equal to 
NGI-SOCAL.  This curve will probably show up every month because the West 
Coast is very volitile.  The change is due to a change in the market.

IF-TW/PERMIAN is a production area curve.  The change is also due to  market 
changes that drove up the curve.

Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

We have been tracking books that are not officialized on a daily basis.  This 
list goes to Sally Beck and is reviewed at the end of each week by Rick Buy.  
Rick has been vocal about taking corrective action if people forget to 
officialize.   It is imperative that we take extra care to ensure that all 
books are marked official each night before going home.  A control process 
should be implemented immediately to absolutely avoid being on the list.  

Please contact me if you have any questions (x-35242).

NEW EMAIL: 
Please look over this and get back with me on any changes you would like to 
make.

I am going to set up a new counterparty in our system:  Enovate LLC.  Under 
this new counterparty will be 3 books in Tagg:  FT-ENOVATE, INTRA-ENOVATE, 
AND FT-INT-ENOVATE.  The INTRA-ENOVATE book will hold deals such as the 
Trunkline deal and will retain Rho & Drift.  The FT-ENOVATE book will be a 
flat book only used for  the confirmation process (deals must be in an FT 
book to be confirmed).  The FT-INT-ENOVATE book will pass Rho & Drift to the 
interest rate group.  This book will be used for EMW related deals not 
specific to Enovate.

The current entity Enron MW LLC will continue to be used and will have the 
following books in Tagg:  FT & Intra NSS1, FT & Intra NSS2, and FT & Intra 
TP.  FT and Intra MEH books will no longer be used.

The P&L will sum the 3 Enovate books to arrive at one number.  The other 
columns on the P&L(NSS1, NSS2, and TP) will be unaffected.

I had planned on just adding the Enovate books, but think we really need to 
set up a new entity as well.  I have run this by accounting and have their 
approval.  Let me know what you think and we will start the process.  We will 
have this completed by the end of this month.

Thanks.

Hey Darron, just been working on year-end stuff here.  Too many late
nights.  I have been keeping up with recruiting.  The guy from Jersey
Village is Abe Robinson, a  O-lineman, TE prospect.  He will probably play
offenseive tackle (6'5" -260 - 4.9) and is a top 10-15 prospect in the
state.  Texas will have a top 5 recruiting class but the problem is that OU
will possible have the top 1 or 2 class and have signed the top defensive
player in Texas, Tommie Harris.   A&M is the odd man out in the mix because
of the emergence of OU and LSU.   A&M is going back to pre-Sherrill days.
I would think they will be looking for a new coach next year.

Let's try to get together soon.  Maybe have lunch or something.

Jeff --

Before I send out the memo for January, I have a few questions about 3 curves 
that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the 
10 curves that were validated for January.  The ones I'm asking you to take a 
look at are:

1)  NGI-SOCAL -- Why the upshift for the entire curve compared to prior 
month?  Why has the shape of the curve changed from (approximately) 1/1/04 
forward compared to the curve from prior month?

2)  IF-MONCHY -- What factors account for differences between the 1/31/01 
curve vs. the 12/29/00 curve for the period between 1/1/01through 1/1/07?

3)  IF-TRANSCO Z3 --  What factors account for the entire curve changing so 
dramatically from last month to this month?



Thanks for your help.

Uncle Clark,

It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.  All four 
of us had a great time.  It was so good to see all of you and especially 
great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.  I really regret 
that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and 
by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).  But even given that, I feel 
as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's 
like we have always spent alot of time together.  I guess that's why they 
call it family.  So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look 
forward to our next get together, wherever and whenever it may be.

Darron

are a number of people who would enjoy shooting each other with paint guns. I 
have narrowed it down to two possible weekends and need your help in 
identifying which would be the best for your respective groups.  

Option one: October 21 or 22
Option two:  November 18-19

Thanks. I want to let you know that ENA's price is now $.1148 higher than 
what Agave invoiced for 08/00. I have paid at the invoiced price, since it is 
less. The difference in the price is in the value for Crude Merc. Your

Darron,

 Do you put together a spreadsheet calculating the price for gas purchases 
from Agave on NNG at the Hobbs Plant? If so, can you forward a copy to me? 
For 08/00 production, there is a $.56 difference from what is in Sitara and 
what the customer invoiced us.

Thanks,

Subject: Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play


Friday, November 10, 2000
IN THE NEWS..."Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,"
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

"It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.


"Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

"Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

"Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

"'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

"When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

"'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

"Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'"

Here is a list by group of suggested improvements for OA.  I will arrange a 
meeting to discuss how we can implement these quickly.  The groups with few 
suggestions are not doing everything correctly,  I  just got fewer to no 
responses out of those groups.  Please thank the people in your groups that 
responded.  I appreciate your help in improving this process.

Thanks,

Gary and I are going to have a "get together" before the Holiday Party on 
Saturday, December 9th.  Please let me know if you want to stop by our place 
before we head out to Enron Field.  We live really only a few miles away from 
downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in 
the "burbs"!   (No names mentioned).  

Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and I will give you directions 
to our place.  Hope all of you can make it!

Thanks,

Subject: Analyst Interviews Needed - 2/15/01



	

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  If 
you are currently on the new Outlook program, you may not be able to use the 
buttons below.  In that instance, please contact me at x39233 to volunteer.  

In addition, we have a need within one of Enron's business units for 
accounting majors.  We will be bringing several people in to interview with 
accounting backgrounds.  We will then make sure that the schedule will be set 
so you would interview these specific candidates.  We would greatly 
appreciate your assistance in this effort.  Thanks in advance for your 
cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

I spoke with Bill K. about the TDS positions problems we had this morning.  
They had to take TDS down this weekend and when it was brought back up all 
the positions were reloaded.  

He thinks the new TDS portcalc will be ready to go later this week which will 
prevent this from happening again.

Subject: Friendly Reminder

This is just a quick reminder for all of you to please go into all of your 
books and flip out all the deals that are supposed to settle with ECC and a 
third counterparty  to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of the day today.  
Nymex closes today, and we need to make sure that all the deals are booked 
correctly for both the Calgary and Houston offices.  This is most important 
for February and March 2001 deals.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for all your help
Stacey

Subject: Fourth of July party!

Hey guys - I am going to have a July 4th celebration at my house (but not on 
the 4th - it will be on the 3rd - Monday).  Kids are welcome, although I 
can't promise things will remain under control all day!!!!  

I am going to get a keg of beer for us, but feel free to bring your beverage 
of choice.  I thought we would grill burgers and hot dogs - so just bring 
your own meat, and I will take care of all the sides.  Feel free to bring 
whatever you want for munchies....plan on an all day/night affair!



Call me if you need directions!  Let me know if you can make it so I can make 
sure I have enough food and drinks!

By the way, I do not have any furniture downstairs, so bring lawnchairs!

It's a funny joke, but obviously not written by a married guy!

Subject: FW: Golf joke




A husband and wife want to take golf lessons from a pro at a local country
club. The man and woman meet the pro and head onto the driving range. The
man goes up to hit first. He swings and hits the ball 100 yards. The golf
pro says not bad. Golfpro: "Now hold the club as firm as you hold your
wife's breasts". The man follows instructions and hits the ball 300 yards.
The golf pro says "Excellent!" Now the woman takes her turn. Her ball goes
30 yards. Golfpro: "Not bad, try holding the club like you hold your
husbands penis." She swings and the ball goes 10 yards. Golfpro: "Not bad,
but now try taking the club out of your mouth and hit the ball."

THE CLASSIC VERSION -
    The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his
house and laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks he's a
fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
in the cold.

THE MODERN VERSION -
 The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his
house and laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks he's a
fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.
    Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and
demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while
others are cold and starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures
of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable
home with a table filled with food.
    "America" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?
Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
when they sing "It's Not Easy Being Green."
    Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS
Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything
they Can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves
by Those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill
refers
to it as "Temperatures of the 80's."
    Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where
the news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome". Jesse then
has
the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's sake.
    Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has
gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax
hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share".
    Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Ant Act",
retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to
hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay
his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.
    Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a
Defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of
federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare
recipients who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM
when there are no talk shows scheduled. The ant loses the case.
    The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of
The ant's food while the government house he is in, which just happens to
be
the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't maintain it. The
ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
bought
by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing
before a wildly applauding group of Democrats announcing that a new era of
"fairness" has dawned in America.
    The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house,
now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once
peaceful neighborhood.

Hi,

Just a friendly reminder for you to please go through all your books to make 
sure
there aren't any deals between ECC and a third counterparty.  If there are, 
please
flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book right away.  Especially those deals that
are Nymex vs. a fixed price for January 2001, these need to be invoiced 
tomorrow.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter.

Thanks for your help

Subject: New Spreadsheet input


Burton,
The following spreadsheets were still loaded from the ng_directory. Rock did 
call me saying that some pipe option spreadsheets were not loading through 
the new process and when I checked it seemed like a network problem and asked 
him to run it again and it seemed to be OK.

With the new process, there is no need for double quotes around the curve 
code and counterparty code columns anymore. This has been automatically taken 
care of since we process from the spreadsheet itself. This was the original 
problem around the pipe option spreadsheets which we discovered yesterday and 
the reason why the numbers did not match between the old and new processes.

I also noticed that INTRA-NORTHEAST-PHY was officialised 4 times - 2 times in 
a row in quick succcession.

I would like Rock or Robin to load these spreadsheets once again during the 
day with Virendra or me as early as possible. We have been consistently been 
able to load these into the test data bases.

The ng spreadsheet also has a quoted price curve code. It should not take any 
time to convert these spreadsheets over.

The ft_northwest sheet seems to be fine - just that it was put into the ng 
directory. Please advise them not to use this directory anymore. Any NT based 
directory will give much better response.

The surprises are the rll and the plastics text files. I thought these were 
the first to go the new spreadsheet format.

Brian Gillis was able to load his spreadsheets successfully through terminal 
server from Calgary yesterday.

Regards,
Ramesh

We have made good progress in resolving ENA's OA variances for the October 
2000 and prior production periods in the past three months.  Our shared goal 
for the May GL accounting period is to resolve ALL OA variances for the 
December 2000 production month and prior.  We realize that this will entail a 
large effort on everyone's part, however, this will provide ENA with current 
OA variance data and eliminate the possibility of carrying variances for a 
prolonged period of time on the exposure schedule. 

If there are any questions, please let me know.  Thank you.

DVD time huh?  I like my player, but there is a substantial premium for it.  
And actually, Sony has come out with the next evolution of the mega DVD 
changer.  I think it lists for $900, but can probably be had for $600-$700 
range.  It is also huge.  I'm not trying to talk you out of it, just let you 
know of the downside.  Both models have identical specs, so quality is not an 
issue.  Let me know if you have anymore questions.

Darron,

What is going on??  Not much here...same old same old.  How is the Mustang
running?  Looks like I will be getting rid of the TA within the next month
or two.  I have been looking pretty hard at Tahoe's and finally have a firm
price to work with.  Anyway, it is about time to get my DVD player and I was
wondering if you are happy with your 200 disc DVD Player.  I can get it off
the internet for ~$400 or I can get Scott's for ~$275.  Sony has released
their next generation of DVD  - I think the 'S' series.  There is one that
is designed to match the Wega tv's.  It is a single disc and costs about
$330 on the internet.  I am not exactly sure what the differences between
the new 'S' series and the 'C' series are.  I don't know if I should get the
new one and pay the extra money or just get an older model.

Well, I win the award for ass of the week and probably the year.  I really 
can't begin to apologize enough for Tuesday.  I won't offer an excuse.  Guys 
on the Central desk asked me a question as soon as I hung up with you, and 
before I knew it, it was around 2:30pm.  But the worst part is, I didn't 
realize what I had done until later the next day.  It was disrespectful and I 
sincerely apologize.  I do have a conflict tomorrow.  And I will understand

Subject: How do officialized books make it to credit?

In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how 
it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at 
X35856.

Stephanie,

We are breaking up our Central Midcon region into two books beginning July 
1.  To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books:  ENA-IM Mid 
Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.  It would be helpful if we could 
have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but 
all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.  The two traders 
involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith.

 Kelli Stevens ENA-IM Mid Central South
 Ed Smith ENA-IM Mid Central North

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to expedite this 
request.  Thanks for your help.

Subject: Price corrections for 6/00 Production

Please correct the following deals:

Enron Canada purchase deal # 121397  Was 4.18427 should be 4.10185  This is 
due to a Buy/back at Chippawa which reduces our Sithe transport by 
$70,191.70   I normally book this manually (with Journal entry) but with SAP, 
it needs to be in Unify and this is the only deal I can book it to.  The 
Sithe transport is in Canadian dollars and this reduction is in US $.


Also I have the following deals which are scheduled different on our side 
that Enron Canada and causes me about a $500 out of balance each month.  We 
have netted this with other out of balances in previous months but with SAP, 
I can no longer do this. Here is what happens:

ENA Books:  Purchase Deal 290657  for 30,390  MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005 = $4,125,442.50
            Sale Deal 290652 for     ( 5,000) MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0075=    678,375.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,067.50
                                                                        
Enron Canada Books:

            Sale                  for 20,000 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005=   $2,715,000.00
  Sale                  for  5,390 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.     =      732,501.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,501.00

I don't know why we book a purchase and sale but it messes up the deal in 
SAP.  Can we change the ENA sale deal 290652 to posting -.005 and the ENA 
purchase deal # 290657 tier it for 25,000 at Posting -.005 and balance at 
posting.  Let me know as soon as possible.  I need to pay this AM on Monday.

Subject: Basis and Index Roll-Off

Again this month, you are going to have to calculate your basis positions 
(officialize) twice.  Once for the TDS download, and once for the Benchmark 
for V@R.  For the TDS calc, all  (100% ) basis needs to show up for prompt 
month.  For the V@R calculations we will need to roll 50% of basis off 
tonight,  and 50% tommorrow.  I would recommend that you use two different 
post ID's to do this.  That way you can use your 100% calc for your curve 
shift report and it will reflect any change in prompt month index as curve 
shift and not a change deal.  We will need two calcs until indexes are set.  
Just to be clear,  calc your 100% basis calc first.  Officialize.  Load your 
positions into TDS. Unofficialize. Calc your 50% basis calc.  Officialize.  
Run all reports off of the 100% basis calc. 

Also,  we will roll-off 50% of all index positions (Gas Daily and Physical) 
tonight and roll-in 50% of physical and gas daily index.  And the other 50% 
tommorrow.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Jeff

How are things?  I hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to see if you 
were going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on 
bringing the whole group up for the KU-UT game that weekend.  I can't believe 
it has almost been 4 years since we last visited up there.  We are doing well 
here in Houston.  Everyone is getting ready for the school year.  In fact, 
Kristi has already started back.  The kids begin on the 9th.  Enron still 
seems to monopolize my time.  But it's a great place to work.  Let me know 
about that weekend.  I hope you will be in town as  I am looking forward to 
seeing you all.

I've attached a list of the 10 deals that I don't recognize.  I grouped them

NEW EMAIL: 
Eric,
I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.  I talked to 
ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.  She does not specifically know about 
the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of 
a reserve behind the scenes.  I don't know for sure, but this has to be how 
the $ got in the West P&L.  It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between 
EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and 
EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).  I 
hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal.  
She ran the transport book at that time.  

The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are 
booked correctly in Sitara.  EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from 
ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.  However, the end date remains '08 
in Sitara.  I don't know why the term was changed.

I have meetings almost all day.  I will still try and investigate, but I know 
you were looking for some answers today.  You may want to try and get in 
touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.

In other words, BFE.  $70 will get you a round of golf, lunch, and beer.  He

Subject: desk level summaries

could you please forward this to your intra-month book admins.
Thanks



The OA group has had many problems in the past with our desk level summaries 
and the break-outs between our books.  Some of the short names get cut off 
and it is hard to tell exactly what books they belong to.  Could you please 
make sure that the values are input on the correct lines, that there is only 
one line per desk and that there are no numbers without a desk assigned to 
them.  Some of the problems they have run into with SAP and the "seller 
rules" is that if both desks do not show the same numbers the seller side is 
assumed to be correct which throws off the other side and gives them an 
adjustment for the desk to take which isn't always correct.   

Here is a list of the desks that are most often misused.

ECT-ENA - IM CE  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MI  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MK  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MA  market east deak
ECT-ENA - IM SI  sithe desk
ECT-EMW - IM MI  enron midwest desk


Please pay special attention to your numbers this month.  Getting this 
corrected up front will take care of a lot of work in the future. 
Please ask me if you have any questions.


Thanks,

Kam

Darin, this is a summary of the Park and Loan deals that you should have. I 
will need to talk to you regarding the Exchange deals that are included on 
the summary of expected revenues. The only exchange that should be recorded 
under enovate should be the enron exchange for $5,000. In that exchange PGL 
Hub received molecules in June and returned them in July, ratable. Other than 
that, if you have any questions call me at 312-541-1233.

Thanks-Steve Richman

QC3611.1
QC4110.1
QC4394.1
QC4496.1

Can you please also go through this book to see if there are any more deals

Thanks for your help

From: Office of the Chairman@ENRON on 06/29/2000 11:46 AM
To: ESOP All Enron N. A.
cc: =20
Subject: EnronOptions - Your Stock Option Program

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=
=20
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =
=01)=20
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=
=20
basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo=
ur=20
Human Resources representative.=20

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=
ing=20
of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal=
=20
regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock=
=20
Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enr=
on=20
companies=01, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, =
labor=20
or business issues.  As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the=20
marketplaces we serve.  Given that need to change, we will continue to refi=
ne=20
the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will=20
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being=
=20
determined on December 29, 2000. =20

NEW EMAIL: 
I watched the second half.  He is a stud.  Westlake actually had a good 
defense also.  I think he wast the first back to run for 100 yds.  We know 
some people from Midland.  They say he is a gangsta.  But they also say Roy 
Williams is a great kid.  Thanks for the info yesterday.

After reviewing the pipeline calculations, the pipeline commodity 
reimbursement should be the following:

Commodity $.0594
Fuel  $.054 (Assuming GD Tenn/500 = $2.775 (Mar 15), and Tennessee Fuel % = 
1.91%)
Total  $.1134

The commodity was adjusted to recover the Tennessee pipeline commodity costs 
not Midwestern pipeline commodity ($.0594 vs. $.0016).  Let Kevin or myself 
know if you have any questions.   Please let us know when this has been 
completed.  Thanks.

yet?  

I wanted to ask if you can help with C&C on the 16th and 17th of May when we 
are in Chicago.  I know your schedule just got alot more hectic, so let me 
know.  They can stay in Conroe on Fri and Sat.  We leave Wed night and return 
Sun morning.  It would mean be staying at our house on those nights and 
getting them to school.  If you can't, we will try to get one of the 
neighbors.

Subject: Changing Deals

Effective immediately,  if anyone changes any deal for any reason,  they need 
to provide a minibook with a before and after of exactly what they did.  This 
used to be a common courtesy,  but it looks like we need a stated policy in 
place.  You guys will therefore have to get minibook access to calc all books 
on a mini-book level from Jeremy.  Please let me know the timing Jeremy gives 
for getting the appropriate people mini-book access as soon as possible.  It 
is critical that we get this done right away.  I know that this is not a 
one-sided issue.  No group is better or more important than any other group.  
It is therefore important that we do a better job of communicating across 
groups.

Thanks,

Jeff


NEW EMAIL: 
Steve,
Congratulations.  Welcome back.  I sent you a note and a spreadsheet with the 
deals we have booked in our system.  I was trying to reconcile them to your 
list of deals.  I could not.  But I think the best thing to do is to simply 
start over and book the deals you tell me to.  I just need the exact terms.  
I know it's your first day back and you are probably swamped, but when you 
get a chance, please give me a call.  Richard wants me to have these deals 
valued by the end of this month's P&L.  Thanks.

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a 
Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA 
and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These 
deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep 
an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Subject: Revival of the Risk brown bag sessions

I have decided to revive the risk brown bag training sessions.

I need, from each of you, a list of the topics you would like to see 
covered.  I would like to see topics ranging from the most basic, up - 
whatever you feel is necessary for your group.  Please provide these to me no 
later than 04/18.  Feel free to offer anything.  Think about the concepts in 
the training modules while you are compiling your lists.

Once I have the topics, I will work with you to arrange a logical order to 
cover them in.  After that  Irena and I will set up a calendar, with 
approximately one session per month.  I am targeting mid-May for the first 
session.

The format of each session is up to the presenter, but a couple of 
suggestions are: a short presentation followed by Q&A, or an open forum.  
Each session will be led by one of you, a suitable substitute, Jeff, or I, 
depending on the topic.  I will schedule, with your input and cooperation, 
who will present each topic.

I am also sending this note to John and Russ.  

John, I ask that you think about OA concepts that you feel will benefit the 
risk group, help our personnel work better with your group, and help us 
understand your duties better.  I would like for you to present at least a 
couple of topics to us.

Russ, if you think there are Sitara issues that would benefit the group, 
please let me know.

I am open to whether these sessions are mandatory or not.  My feeling is that 
some should be and others (the ones of a more basic nature) should only be 
mandatory for those people you feel need that month's subject matter.  Let me 
know your opinion on this.

With a small investment of your time, I believe this will be an excellent 
vehicle to get (and keep) topics of interest and training in front of your 
people.

I look forward to receiving your lists.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Greg

The $1.7M is in Jim's book.  He asked me to hold it back because he thought 
the curve for ChiGate was set too high and he was making too much on Friday.  
I think the $ is real, and it will be released before year end.

I don't know about the annuity.  Kevin will return tomorrow and he will have 
to follow up with you.  I'll send the prior day P&L's tonight.

Can you guys confirm that we have $1.7 million top-leveled to allow for the 
NGPL ITS losses that we have not put into the books yets?  We need to put 
these losses in on Thursday or friday.

Also did we reverse the $326000 annuity and subsequent origination out of my 
bookes and the FT-cental books?  We should have a new annuity to PGL for the 
same amount.

Can you send me a copy of the top page for enovate for last Friday and 
Thursday like the one you sent me today for Monday's top page?

Call me if you have any questions at 312.925.8906

I was wondering why you were waiting so long to respond.  I'm glad he is 
staying.  I think it says something about his commitment to the program he

The deal number in Sitara was changed because of an internal book name 
change.  It had nothing to do with the monetization status of the deal.  If 
this has caused a problem, let me know.  I didn't think that just changing 
the deal number would have this effect.   Thanks.

Darron, 

Sitara indicates that the below deal #10129 was changed to deal #312218.  
Steve Ross with Company 103 and my records indicate that this deal should 
have been monetized until September prod.  Please let me know if you show 
otherwise, as monetized volume stopped flowing as of July production.  

Thank you, Melissa

Melissa,
We are missing the CIG/NNG pull for deal 10129.  The 232,500 is south TX deal 
10132 which is booked.  Past history
has the 10129 deal pulling the same quantity as the 10132.   I am just trying 
to figure out were the other half of the monthly pull might be if in fact
there is any.  

Thanks

Steve, 

Please field all monetized questions/requests through me.  We have many new 
faces, most of which have not yet been trained on monetizations.  We are 
actually restructuring which coordinators will be handling the monetized 
contracts and once completed, we will have firm contacts for you. 

To answer your question, Wisconsin Electric Power deal #10132 and 10129 are 
still valid until 9/00, but I booked invoice #13470SA on your books in Doc 
#1600000445 for 232500 mmbtu and $1,011,549.39.  Is this not what you were 
looking for?  Please explain further.

Thanks!  Melissa

Is the CIG/NNG DUMAS contract expired?  My water fall is still looking for 
monthly MMBtu and there is none for July production
yielding  the above short fall.  Please let me know today as I am procesiing 
this months' payment.

Thanks

Subject: WeaponX

I would like each of your book admins using WeaponX to begin using the 
following procedures at least once/week (if they aren't already).

Open the database while holding down on the shift key.  This will open the 
database, but prevent the main form from opening automatically.  Next, the 
admin should go to Access menu selections and choose Tools/Database 
Utilities/Compact Database.  After the database has completed compacting, you 
can use the database as normal.

Just a quick explanation:

This is standard procedure for Access databases.  WeaponX imports and deletes 
a lot of data on a daily basis.  When data is deleted, the space is not freed 
up that was used by the data.  Therefore, as time goes by, the database size 
grows and grows and needs to be periodically compacted.

The Texas WeaponX file that I compacted reduced from 520 MB to 30 MB and one 
for the west went from 400 MB to 12 MB.  You can see that we will save 
several GB if everyone begins compacting the databases on a regular basis.

Please note:  Even though this is standard Access procedure, I would 
recommend that the book admin save a copy of their existing WeaponX file 
prior to compacting for the first time.  Once the file is compacted and a 
daily run has been successful, they can delete the backup file.  It is not 
necessary for them to save a backup copy each time before compacting.  I am 
only recommending it for the first compact.

I don't anticipate any problems with this procedure.  As a matter of fact, 
Crystal (East desk I believe) already compacts the database on a daily 
basis.  In addition Ann (West desk) ran a test for me with no problems.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Greg

I have encountered the following problems calcing at home.

1.  On my Portcalc screen, everything was very tiny.  It worked but I know I 
couldn't copy a post id because I wouldn't be able to see the new number.

2.  I wanted to look at my curves last night and they opened up with errors.  
Basically it's like opening up the curves on a machine without the correct 
drivers.  Seems like we need to put those drivers on the network and maybe 
upgrade it to Oracle 8i too.

3.  I don't know how we can change the printer to print at home.  Only 
concern here is if we are offsite and have a local printer (will we be able 
to put that printer on the network?).  

That's all I can think of right now.

Any suggestions?

Jeff, attached is a file containing gas curves that have been identified as 
being not in the RisktRAC system.  Curves were found to be missing from  the 
Benchmark mapping table and/or the Primary/Secondary curve table.  Curves 
missing from RisktRAC could have a significant impact on positions and V@R.  
Please let us know by Thursday, April 26th, if these curves should be added 
to the RisktRAC system.   For those curves that need to be added to RisktRAC, 
a blank curve request form is also attached. Thank you.

NEW EMAIL: 
I just wanted to pass along my thanks for the efforts of your team.  The 
automatic bridge to Sitara and Tagg will save us an extraordinary amount of 
time; especially during bidweek.  I know there are others who deserve thanks 
in addition to Dawn, so please let them know we appreciate their hard work as 
well.  I don't want to seem greedy, but I'll ask anyway.  When do you think 
we will be able to get the Sitara number entered in the Link field in Tagg?  
Also, can we get the Tagg number entered in SCI?  Thanks again.

Just when you thought you knew everything (no, it's not an anti cola add  
;-)...  

1.In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck  
to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
2.You can put a  T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two 
days. 
3.To clean a  toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl....... Let 
the "real thing"  sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains  from vitreous china. 
5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the  bumper with a 
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in  Coca-Cola. 
6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of  Coca-Cola 
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 
7.To loosen a  rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the 
rusted bolt for several  minutes. 
8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking  pan;rap the 
ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is  finished, 
remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a  sumptuous 
brown gravy. 
9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke  into a load of greasy 
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.  The Coca-Cola will 
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze  fromyour 
windshield.  

FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It  
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 
2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the  concentrate) the commercial truck must use 
the Hazardous material place cards  reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
3.The distributors of coke have  been using it to clean the engines of their 
trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!  No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
drinks do to your teeth on a daily  basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of 
coke in 24-48 hours.

Subject: Termination of EnronOnline Trades

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.

Jay,

There is still some cash in the custodial accounts.  I wanted you to buy more 
of the existing mutual funds.  Also, I am going to write a check out of my 
CMA account for more than the current cash balance.  Do I need to sell some 
mutual fund shares? Or is it automatic?  Let me know.  Nice game in Palo

Hi guys,

I didnt' come across any deals with Duke Energy Marketing LP and ECC in your 
books, so I think there may be some being booked still as ENA and DEMLP.  
These all need to be flipped to settle in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS books like the 
rest of these deals.  I've spoken to Jennifer Denny with EOL about getting a 
program set up for Duke deals similar to ones we have with TransCanada Energy 
and Dynegy Canada so they automatically get booked to settle with ECC, but I 
don't think this has happened yet.  Please go through your books to make sure 
that no Duke deals have been missed.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for all your help
Stacey

Thanks for the list of existing transactions.  Only one question, it looks 
like the list includes only the different corporate entities of NICOR.  Does 
that mean that there were no existing transactions with the other Corporate 
families, i.e. NIPSCO, CILCO, PGL and NS?

Thanks,

NEW EMAIL: 
If you have any questions about this let me know.  It will be a pain in the 
ass if the deal is between Enovate and Oneok but is then flipped to EMW to 
manage.  There will be twice as many legs and the volumes will need to be 
adusted at minimum on a monthly basis, and likely a weekly basis.  Again, let 
me know if you need anything.

cc: Gregg Penman, Darron C Giron/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Mixon, Kay 
Classen/NA/Enron@Enron, Lee Fascetti, Paul Burgener, hermannt@pecorp.com 
Subject: OneOK storage deal

Enovate sold a virtual storage service to OneOk marketing.  

Transaction parameters:
MSV = 500,000 mmbtu
Daily injection \ withdraw rights = 0-25,000
enovate's demand charge = $1.75 per MSV mmbtu
Commodity charges = none
Term: Apr01 - Mar02
Location: People's Citygate



As we all know, our risk managment systems will not handle this kind of a 
transaction without al ot of manual manipulation. Below are my 
recommendations for booking this transaction.

1.  enovate should book the expected usage pattern based on the current 
market curve with a zero price (and hedge, if the trader wants) in enovate's 
MTM risk books.  The trader should periodically adjust this usage pattern as 
market conditions change.  The negative fallout from this expected usage 
should be applied against the demand charge.
 
2. As Oneok actually withdraws or injects gas into the virtual storage, we 
should record the transaction in Sitara and adjust our expected usage deal.  
The trader can hedge this position financially, physically or may be able to 
use the PGL Hub.

3. The demand charge should be booked in Tagg & Sitara and offset with 
financial annuity so we will not realize any MTM gain on the demand charge.  
We will adjust this financial annuity as losses are incurred.  Once the 
annuity is all used up, we will take all losses as incurred.  Any annuity 
amount left over at completion of the program will be taken as a gain at that 
time.

4.  This deal will be managed in the EMW book eventhough the actual 
injections\withdraws will be recorded in the enovate book.  The enovate 
physcial book will be flat - in and out at a zero price.

Cost of Carry should work in our favor unless they elect to go negative 
early.  All cash requirement should fall out in our EMW books.

Jim will build a model to determine the expected usage and track his related 
hedges (This will be similar to what Lee has, but not as complicated)

This is not intended to be a comprehensive description of how to book this 
transaction, only an outline what I believe should be reflected in our 
books.  Please forward any questions or comments to me.  Thanks.

Richard

Subject: Aquila Canada Corp. deals in Houston books

Hi guys,

I've just come across a few deals that are in TAGG as settling between
ENA and Aquila Canada Corp.  These deals would not have shown up when
you looked for deals to flip to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as they aren't in
TAGG as ECC deals.  I have a feeling that there are lots of deals like this in
TAGG, but I just don't know where. We are having problems printing TAGG 
tickets 
up here, so I'm not able to see which books these deals are in right now.  
What I'm 
requesting is that you go through all your books and look for all deals with 
Aquila
Canada Corp. that are to settle for March and April 2001, and after, and flip 
these
deals into the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  As it stands, 
I'm missing at least 10 deals from the April 2001 Nymex invoice, and I want to
make sure that these deals don't get invoiced by someone in Houston 
settlements.
Nymex settled yesterday for April, so invoicing for these deals is taking 
place
today.  

I understand that you are all very busy right now, but it would really be 
appreciated
if this was dealt with as soon as possible today.  The settlements group and 
I need
to get our invoices sent out today, so we need these deals to be fixed right 
away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter, and let me know 
if I 
can assist you in any way.

Thanks so much for your help
Stacey-

This is a modification of the old file.  If you had the same book and

This one requires a comment in all post-id's to pull in only those.

NEW EMAIL: 
Darron,

I met this man's wife, Nadia Rodriquez, in orientation.  Here is what she 
said about her husband's work experience.

"My husband just finished his MBA and his company's moving to Atlanta.  He 
has been offered two positions there but we would rather stay here.  His 
background has been in the securities industry, most recently in compliance 
where he ensures that brokers follow NASD and SEC regulations in all aspects 
(e.g. trading, marketing, etc.).  Prior to the compliance role, he was a 
broker with PaineWebber.  Also, he has extensive computer skills and is used 
to dealing with all levels of personnel."

She should be sending me his resume soon.

: Thermics of Hell

The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington
chemistry mid term.  The answer by one student was so profound that the
professor shared it with colleagues, via the Internet, which is, of course,
why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well.

Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs
heat)?

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law, (gas
cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some
variant.  One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need
to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are
leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it
will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are
entering Hell, lets look at the different
religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that
if you are not a member of their religion,
you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and
since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that
all souls go to Hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in
Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the
volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature
and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand
proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:
1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter
Hell, then the temperature and pressure   in Hell will increase until all
Hell breaks loose.

2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell,
then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So
which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year,
....that it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you, and take
into
account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations
with her, then, #2 cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is
exothermic and will not freeze.

Tell Dan that a glacier moves forward, not backward.  On a balk, the batter 
does not advance, only the baserunners.  But he may have a point with cricket.

What to Expect From Gun Control

 these are the facts right out of the history books

 Interesting bit of information.





 "In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to

 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were

 rounded up and exterminated.



 "In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5

 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million

 Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million

 political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000

 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000

 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.



 "Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one

 million 'educated' people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up

and exterminated."



 Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century

 because of gun control: 56 million.



 The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, ask them "Who do

 YOU want to round up and exterminate?" With guns, we are citizens. Without

 them, we are subjects.

I was informed by the Sitara team that there are still sitara deals 
duplicated from yesterday's bridging "issues".  I have them highlighted in 
red in the e-mail below.  
Please kill the duplicate sitara number as soon as possible.  I believe 
atleast one of them is for gas flowing tomorrow!  If you need further 
information or assistance, contact me at 3-9353.

Thanks,

The Sitara group is getting prepared to be converting all cash desk financial 
deals into Sitara.  Could you have someone send me a list of the different 
books used in Tagg to book deals for the Central cash desk.  We are also 
working on an application to display the risks on the physical deals booked in
Sitara.  Could you also have sent to me a list of the different regions that 
your desk wants to have its physical positions broken up into.

If you have any questions, please call me.

No interns.  As long as my group stays intact I won't need anyone in August.  
I think Anne will stay past her 1 year and everyone else is relatively new.

My niece sent this today...got a good laugh from it!

Liz

A lady stopped unexpectedly by her recently married son's house.  She rang
the doorbell and stepped into the house to see her daughter-in-law standing
naked by the door.
"What are you doing?" she asked.
"I am waiting for my husband to come home from work," the daughter-in-law
replied.
"Why are you naked?" asked the mother-in-law.
"This is my love dress," the daughter-in-law replied.
"LOVE DRESS! You're naked," said the mother-in-law.
"But my husband loves it when I wear this dress. It makes him happy and he
makes me happy," said the  daughter-in-law "He will be home any minute now,
so perhaps you could stop by a little later?"
Soured by all of this romantic stuff, the mother-in-law left.
On the way home, she thought about the "LOVE DRESS" and got an idea. She
undressed, showered, applied her best perfume, and waited by the door for
her husband to come home.
Finally, his pickup truck drove up the drive way. Her husband opened the
door, and immediately saw his naked wife.
"What are you doing?" he asked.
"This is my love dress." She said, excitedly.
"Needs ironing." He replied.

Subject: New Book Codes

During the August settlement period, we discovered at least 4 book codes that 
had just recently started containing financial, third-party deals in them.  
We tried to put a procedure into place where we were calling the risk guys to 
find out about new books.  I don't know, however, if we are calling the right 
people because we were not told about the 4 books that we discovered on our 
own.  

From now on, I am going to have Beatrice Reyna from my group call someone 
from Reporting (Frank) and key people in Risk before we run our NYMEX 
invoices at the end of the month.  Will, can you please send me a list of 
people that Bea should contact that would know what we are talking about?  
Even if the book codes are not brand new, but if they have just started 
putting financial deals in them, WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM.  

Thanks you so much for your help,
Becky
